Match 0: "what an extremely nice house to come into!"
Match 1: "now, do you think we're enjoying ourselves enormously?"
Match 2: "mr. denham, mother,"
Match 3: "now, what would you do if you were married to an engineer, and had to live in manchester, mr. denham?"
Match 4: "surely she could learn persian,"
Match 5: "is there no retired schoolmaster or man of letters in manchester with whom she could read persian?"
Match 6: "a cousin of ours has married and gone to live in manchester,"
Match 7: "have you ever been to manchester?"
Match 8: "never,"
Match 9: "why do you object to it, then?"
Match 10: "i should think there would be no one to talk to in manchester,"
Match 11: "in spite of a slight tendency to exaggeration, katharine decidedly hits the mark,"
Match 12: "oh, mr. fortescue,"
Match 13: "i had just written to say how i envied her! i was thinking of the big gardens and the dear old ladies in mittens, who read nothing but the "
Match 14: " and snuff the candles. have they all disappeared? i told her she would find the nice things of london without the horrid streets that depress one so."
Match 15: "there is the university,"
Match 16: "i know there are moors there, because i read about them in a book the other day,"
Match 17: "i am grieved and amazed at the ignorance of my family,"
Match 18: "would it be the battle of trafalgar or the spanish armada, katharine?"
Match 19: "trafalgar, mother."
Match 20: "trafalgar, of course! how stupid of me! another cup of tea, with a thin slice of lemon in it, and then, dear mr. fortescue, please explain my absurd little puzzle. one can't help believing gentlemen with roman noses, even if one meets them in omnibuses."
Match 21: "d'you know, mr. denham, you remind me so much of dear mr. ruskin.... is it his tie, katharine, or his hair, or the way he sits in his chair? do tell me, mr. denham, are you an admirer of ruskin? some one, the other day, said to me, 'oh, no, we don't read ruskin, mrs. hilbery.' what do you read, i wonder?--for you can't spend all your time going up in aeroplanes and burrowing into the bowels of the earth."
Match 22: "i'm sure mr. denham would like to see our things, katharine. i'm sure he's not like that dreadful young man, mr. ponting, who told me that he considered it our duty to live exclusively in the present. after all, what is the present? half of it's the past, and the better half, too, i should say,"
Match 23: "perhaps you would like to see the pictures,"
Match 24: "there!"
Match 25: "this is his writing-table. he used this pen,"
Match 26: "i think my grandfather must have been at least twice as large as any one is nowadays. this,"
Match 27: "is the original manuscript of the 'ode to winter.' the early poems are far less corrected than the later. would you like to look at it?"
Match 28: "this is a copy of the first edition of the poems,"
Match 29: "which contains several poems that have not been reprinted, as well as corrections."
Match 30: "that lady in blue is my great-grandmother, by millington. here is my uncle's walking-stick--he was sir richard warburton, you know, and rode with havelock to the relief of lucknow. and then, let me see--oh, that's the original alardyce, 1697, the founder of the family fortunes, with his wife. some one gave us this bowl the other day because it has their crest and initials. we think it must have been given them to celebrate their silver wedding-day."
Match 31: "you must be very proud of your family, miss hilbery."
Match 32: "yes, i am,"
Match 33: "do you think there's anything wrong in that?"
Match 34: "wrong? how should it be wrong? it must be a bore, though, showing your things to visitors,"
Match 35: "not if the visitors like them."
Match 36: "isn't it difficult to live up to your ancestors?"
Match 37: "i dare say i shouldn't try to write poetry,"
Match 38: "no. and that's what i should hate. i couldn't bear my grandfather to cut me out. and, after all,"
Match 39: "it's not your grandfather only. you're cut out all the way round. i suppose you come of one of the most distinguished families in england. there are the warburtons and the mannings--and you're related to the otways, aren't you? i read it all in some magazine,"
Match 40: "the otways are my cousins,"
Match 41: "well,"
Match 42: "well,"
Match 43: "i don't see that you've proved anything."
Match 44: "well,"
Match 45: "but aren't you proud of your family?"
Match 46: "no,"
Match 47: "we've never done anything to be proud of--unless you count paying one's bills a matter for pride."
Match 48: "that sounds rather dull,"
Match 49: "you would think us horribly dull,"
Match 50: "yes, i might find you dull, but i don't think i should find you ridiculous,"
Match 51: "no--because we're not in the least ridiculous. we're a respectable middle-class family, living at highgate."
Match 52: "we don't live at highgate, but we're middle class too, i suppose."
Match 53: "that belonged to clive, so we say,"
Match 54: "is it a lie?"
Match 55: "it's a family tradition. i don't know that we can prove it."
Match 56: "you see, we don't have traditions in our family,"
Match 57: "you sound very dull,"
Match 58: "merely middle class,"
Match 59: "you pay your bills, and you speak the truth. i don't see why you should despise us."
Match 60: "i shouldn't like to be you; that's all i said,"
Match 61: "no, but one never would like to be any one else."
Match 62: "i should. i should like to be lots of other people."
Match 63: "then why not us?"
Match 64: "you'll never know anything at first hand,"
Match 65: "it's all been done for you. you'll never know the pleasure of buying things after saving up for them, or reading books for the first time, or making discoveries."
Match 66: "go on,"
Match 67: "of course, i don't know how you spend your time,"
Match 68: "but i suppose you have to show people round. you are writing a life of your grandfather, aren't you? and this kind of thing"
Match 69: "must take up a lot of time."
Match 70: "you've got it very nearly right,"
Match 71: "but i only help my mother. i don't write myself."
Match 72: "do you do anything yourself?"
Match 73: "what do you mean?"
Match 74: "i don't leave the house at ten and come back at six."
Match 75: "i don't mean that."
Match 76: "nobody ever does do anything worth doing nowadays,"
Match 77: "you see"
Match 78: "we don't even print as well as they did, and as for poets or painters or novelists--there are none; so, at any rate, i'm not singular."
Match 79: "no, we haven't any great men,"
Match 80: "i'm very glad that we haven't. i hate great men. the worship of greatness in the nineteenth century seems to me to explain the worthlessness of that generation."
Match 81: "well,"
Match 82: "how do you like our things, mr. denham?"
Match 83: "there are some books that live,"
Match 84: "they are young with us, and they grow old with us. are you fond of poetry, mr. denham? but what an absurd question to ask! the truth is, dear mr. fortescue has almost tired me out. he is so eloquent and so witty, so searching and so profound that, after half an hour or so, i feel inclined to turn out all the lights. but perhaps he'd be more wonderful than ever in the dark. what d'you think, katharine? shall we give a little party in complete darkness? there'd have to be bright rooms for the bores...."
Match 85: "but we've any number of things to show you!"
Match 86: "books, pictures, china, manuscripts, and the very chair that mary queen of scots sat in when she heard of darnley's murder. i must lie down for a little, and katharine must change her dress (though she's wearing a very pretty one), but if you don't mind being left alone, supper will be at eight. i dare say you'll write a poem of your own while you're waiting. ah, how i love the firelight! doesn't our room look charming?"
Match 87: "dear things!"
Match 88: "dear chairs and tables! how like old friends they are--faithful, silent friends. which reminds me, katharine, little mr. anning is coming to-night, and tite street, and cadogan square.... do remember to get that drawing of your great-uncle glazed. aunt millicent remarked it last time she was here, and i know how it would hurt me to see my father in a broken glass."
Match 89: "she'll do.... yes, katharine hilbery'll do.... i'll take katharine hilbery."
Match 90: "mother says, aren't you coming down, ralph? uncle joseph--"
Match 91: "they're to bring my dinner up here,"
Match 92: "ralph!"
Match 93: "critical review."
Match 94: "although she's wearing such a pretty one,"
Match 95: "ralph?"
Match 96: "joan?"
Match 97: "i was coming up, but i saw your notice."
Match 98: "well, come along in, then."
Match 99: "it's about charles and uncle john's offer.... mother's been talking to me. she says she can't afford to pay for him after this term. she says she'll have to ask for an overdraft as it is."
Match 100: "that's simply not true,"
Match 101: "no. i thought not. but she won't believe me when i say it."
Match 102: "i'm not interrupting?"
Match 103: "she doesn't understand that one's got to take risks,"
Match 104: "i believe mother would take risks if she knew that charles was the sort of boy to profit by it."
Match 105: "he's got brains, hasn't he?"
Match 106: "in some ways he's fearfully backward, though, compared with what you were at his age. and he's difficult at home, too. he makes molly slave for him."
Match 107: "she,"
Match 108: "it's pretty hard lines to stick a boy into an office at seventeen!"
Match 109: "nobody wants to stick him into an office,"
Match 110: "the truth is,"
Match 111: "that i ought to have accepted uncle john's offer. i should have been making six hundred a year by this time."
Match 112: "i don't think that for a moment,"
Match 113: "the question, to my mind, is, whether we couldn't cut down our expenses in some way."
Match 114: "a smaller house?"
Match 115: "fewer servants, perhaps."
Match 116: "it's out of the question."
Match 117: "if mother won't run risks--"
Match 118: "you really can't expect her to sell out again."
Match 119: "she ought to look upon it as an investment; but if she won't, we must find some other way, that's all."
Match 120: "i think you'd be foolish to risk your money on poor old charles,"
Match 121: "fond as i am of him, he doesn't seem to me exactly brilliant.... besides, why should you be sacrificed?"
Match 122: "my dear joan,"
Match 123: "don't you see that we've all got to be sacrificed? what's the use of denying it? what's the use of struggling against it? so it always has been, so it always will be. we've got no money and we never shall have any money. we shall just turn round in the mill every day of our lives until we drop and die, worn out, as most people do, when one comes to think of it."
Match 124: "aren't you happy, ralph?"
Match 125: "no. are you? perhaps i'm as happy as most people, though. god knows whether i'm happy or not. what is happiness?"
Match 126: "happiness,"
Match 127: "hilda was here to-day,"
Match 128: "she brought bobbie--he's a fine boy now."
Match 129: "shall you talk to mother?"
Match 130: "because, you see, the thing's got to be settled, one way or another. charles must write to uncle john if he's going there."
Match 131: "i suppose it doesn't much matter either way,"
Match 132: "he's doomed to misery in the long run."
Match 133: "you know you're talking nonsense,"
Match 134: "it doesn't hurt any one to have to earn their own living. i'm very glad i have to earn mine."
Match 135: "isn't that only because you've forgotten how to enjoy yourself? you never have time for anything decent--"
Match 136: "as for instance?"
Match 137: "well, going for walks, or music, or books, or seeing interesting people. you never do anything that's really worth doing any more than i do."
Match 138: "i always think you could make this room much nicer, if you liked,"
Match 139: "what does it matter what sort of room i have when i'm forced to spend all the best years of my life drawing up deeds in an office?"
Match 140: "you said two days ago that you found the law so interesting."
Match 141: "so it is if one could afford to know anything about it."
Match 142: "that's herbert only just going to bed now,"
Match 143: "and then he won't get up in the morning."
Match 144: "d'you ever pay calls now?"
Match 145: "i don't often have the time. why do you ask?"
Match 146: "it might be a good thing, to get to know new people, that's all."
Match 147: "poor ralph!"
Match 148: "you think your sister's getting very old and very dull--that's it, isn't it?"
Match 149: "i don't think anything of the kind,"
Match 150: "but you lead a dog's life, joan. when you're not working in an office, you're worrying over the rest of us. and i'm not much good to you, i'm afraid."
Match 151: "hereditary genius,"
Match 152: "good and great man."
Match 153: "from india,"
Match 154: "remember all your life."
Match 155: "well done, katharine! what a wonderful head for business you've got! now i shall keep this before me, and every day i shall make a little mark in my pocketbook, and on the last day of all--let me think, what shall we do to celebrate the last day of all? if it weren't the winter we could take a jaunt to italy. they say switzerland's very lovely in the snow, except for the cold. but, as you say, the great thing is to finish the book. now let me see--"
Match 156: "your wicked old uncle judge peter, who used to be heard delivering sentence of death in the bathroom. thank heaven, katharine, i've not a drop of him in me!"
Match 157: "and here we are,"
Match 158: "talking about art."
Match 159: "alone?"
Match 160: "i am sometimes alone,"
Match 161: "but you expect a great many people,"
Match 162: "it's like a room on the stage. who is it to-night?"
Match 163: "william rodney, upon the elizabethan use of metaphor. i expect a good solid paper, with plenty of quotations from the classics."
Match 164: "i suppose you are the only woman in london who darns her own stockings,"
Match 165: "i'm only one of a great many thousands really,"
Match 166: "though i must admit that i was thinking myself very remarkable when you came in. and now that you're here i don't think myself remarkable at all. how horrid of you! but i'm afraid you're much more remarkable than i am. you've done much more than i've done."
Match 167: "if that's your standard, you've nothing to be proud of,"
Match 168: "well, i must reflect with emerson that it's being and not doing that matters,"
Match 169: "emerson?"
Match 170: "you don't mean to say you read emerson?"
Match 171: "perhaps it wasn't emerson; but why shouldn't i read emerson?"
Match 172: "there's no reason that i know of. it's the combination that's odd--books and stockings. the combination is very odd."
Match 173: "you always say that,"
Match 174: "i assure you it's a common 'combination,' as you call it, in the houses of the clergy. the only thing that's odd about me is that i enjoy them both--emerson and the stocking."
Match 175: "damn those people! i wish they weren't coming!"
Match 176: "it's only mr. turner, on the floor below,"
Match 177: "will there be a crowd?"
Match 178: "there'll be the morrises and the crashaws, and dick osborne, and septimus, and all that set. katharine hilbery is coming, by the way, so william rodney told me."
Match 179: "katharine hilbery!"
Match 180: "you know her?"
Match 181: "i went to a tea-party at her house."
Match 182: "but, in spite of what you say, i do admire her,"
Match 183: "i've only seen her once or twice, but she seems to me to be what one calls a 'personality.'"
Match 184: "i didn't mean to abuse her. i only felt that she wasn't very sympathetic to me."
Match 185: "they say she's going to marry that queer creature rodney."
Match 186: "marry rodney? then she must be more deluded than i thought her."
Match 187: "now that's my door, all right,"
Match 188: "oh!"
Match 189: "in undertaking to speak of the elizabethan use of metaphor in poetry--"
Match 190: "fancy marrying a creature like that!"
Match 191: "well, katharine, i hope i've made a big enough fool of myself even for you! it was terrible! terrible! terrible!"
Match 192: "hush! you must answer their questions,"
Match 193: "idiot!"
Match 194: "he's misunderstood every word i said!"
Match 195: "well then, answer him,"
Match 196: "no, i shan't! they'd only laugh at me. why did i let you persuade me that these sort of people care for literature?"
Match 197: "that was what i call a first-rate paper."
Match 198: "let's go and tell him how much we liked it,"
Match 199: "that was a very interesting paper,"
Match 200: "will you lend me the manuscript to read in peace?"
Match 201: "do you say that merely to disguise the fact of my ridiculous failure?"
Match 202: "he says he doesn't mind what we think of him,"
Match 203: "he says we don't care a rap for art of any kind."
Match 204: "i asked her to pity me, and she teases me!"
Match 205: "i don't intend to pity you, mr. rodney,"
Match 206: "when a paper's a failure, nobody says anything, whereas now, just listen to them!"
Match 207: "d'you think that's all about my paper?"
Match 208: "of course it is,"
Match 209: "it was a very suggestive paper."
Match 210: "it's the ten minutes after a paper is read that proves whether it's been a success or not,"
Match 211: "if i were you, rodney, i should be very pleased with myself."
Match 212: "suggestive."
Match 213: "did you agree at all, denham, with what i said about shakespeare's later use of imagery? i'm afraid i didn't altogether make my meaning plain."
Match 214: "did you remember to get that picture glazed before your aunt came to dinner?"
Match 215: "you remember the passage just before the death of the duchess?"
Match 216: "personality,"
Match 217: "they're exactly like a flock of sheep, aren't they?"
Match 218: "i wonder what they're making such a noise about?"
Match 219: "the elizabethans, i suppose."
Match 220: "no, i don't think it's got anything to do with the elizabethans. there! didn't you hear them say, 'insurance bill'?"
Match 221: "i wonder why men always talk about politics?"
Match 222: "i suppose, if we had votes, we should, too."
Match 223: "i dare say we should. and you spend your life in getting us votes, don't you?"
Match 224: "i do,"
Match 225: "from ten to six every day i'm at it."
Match 226: "i suppose you're one of the people who think we should all have professions,"
Match 227: "oh dear no,"
Match 228: "well, i think i do,"
Match 229: "you will always be able to say that you've done something, whereas, in a crowd like this, i feel rather melancholy."
Match 230: "in a crowd? why in a crowd?"
Match 231: "don't you see how many different things these people care about? and i want to beat them down--i only mean,"
Match 232: "that i want to assert myself, and it's difficult, if one hasn't a profession."
Match 233: "ah, but i want to trample upon their prostrate bodies!"
Match 234: "one doesn't necessarily trample upon people's bodies because one runs an office,"
Match 235: "no. perhaps not,"
Match 236: "yes, they're very like sheep,"
Match 237: "and yet they are very clever--at least,"
Match 238: "i suppose they have all read webster."
Match 239: "surely you don't think that a proof of cleverness? i've read webster, i've read ben jonson, but i don't think myself clever--not exactly, at least."
Match 240: "i think you must be very clever,"
Match 241: "why? because i run an office?"
Match 242: "i wasn't thinking of that. i was thinking how you live alone in this room, and have parties."
Match 243: "it means, chiefly, a power of being disagreeable to one's own family, i think. i have that, perhaps. i didn't want to live at home, and i told my father. he didn't like it.... but then i have a sister, and you haven't, have you?"
Match 244: "no, i haven't any sisters."
Match 245: "you are writing a life of your grandfather?"
Match 246: "yes, i am helping my mother,"
Match 247: "egoist."
Match 248: "she's an egoist,"
Match 249: "heavens, what a mess there'll be to-morrow morning!"
Match 250: "i hope you don't sleep in this room, miss datchet?"
Match 251: "what are you laughing at?"
Match 252: "i won't tell you."
Match 253: "let me guess. you were laughing because you thought i'd changed the conversation?"
Match 254: "no."
Match 255: "because you think--"
Match 256: "if you want to know, i was laughing at the way you said miss datchet."
Match 257: "mary, then. mary, mary, mary."
Match 258: "mary datchet,"
Match 259: "it's not such an imposing name as katharine hilbery, i'm afraid."
Match 260: "i wonder, miss hilbery, whether you remembered to get that picture glazed?"
Match 261: "oh, you idiot!"
Match 262: "mensa."
Match 263: "picture--what picture?"
Match 264: "oh, at home, you mean--that sunday afternoon. was it the day mr. fortescue came? yes, i think i remembered it."
Match 265: "you know the names of the stars, i suppose?"
Match 266: "i know how to find the pole star if i'm lost."
Match 267: "i don't suppose that often happens to you."
Match 268: "no. nothing interesting ever happens to me,"
Match 269: "i think you make a system of saying disagreeable things, miss hilbery,"
Match 270: "i suppose it's one of the characteristics of your class. they never talk seriously to their inferiors."
Match 271: "in what sense are you my inferior?"
Match 272: "i don't think i understand what you mean,"
Match 273: "hum"
Match 274: "ha,"
Match 275: "i hear that bennett has given up his theory of truth."
Match 276: "i promise i won't say another word about it, katharine! but do stop a minute and look at the moon upon the water."
Match 277: "i'm sure one can smell the sea, with the wind blowing this way,"
Match 278: "ah!"
Match 279: "why can't one say how beautiful it all is? why am i condemned for ever, katharine, to feel what i can't express? and the things i can give there's no use in my giving. trust me, katharine,"
Match 280: "i won't speak of it again. but in the presence of beauty--look at the iridescence round the moon!--one feels--one feels--perhaps if you married me--i'm half a poet, you see, and i can't pretend not to feel what i do feel. if i could write--ah, that would be another matter. i shouldn't bother you to marry me then, katharine."
Match 281: "but for me i suppose you would recommend marriage?"
Match 282: "certainly i should. not for you only, but for all women. why, you're nothing at all without it; you're only half alive; using only half your faculties; you must feel that for yourself. that is why--"
Match 283: "with how sad steps she climbs the sky,     how silently and with how wan a face,"
Match 284: "i've been told a great many unpleasant things about myself to-night,"
Match 285: "mr. denham seems to think it his mission to lecture me, though i hardly know him. by the way, william, you know him; tell me, what is he like?"
Match 286: "we may lecture you till we're blue in the face--"
Match 287: "yes--but what's he like?"
Match 288: "and we write sonnets to your eyebrows, you cruel practical creature. denham?"
Match 289: "a good fellow, i should think. he cares, naturally, for the right sort of things, i expect. but you mustn't marry him, though. he scolded you, did he--what did he say?"
Match 290: "what happens with mr. denham is this: he comes to tea. i do all i can to put him at his ease. he merely sits and scowls at me. then i show him our manuscripts. at this he becomes really angry, and tells me i've no business to call myself a middle-class woman. so we part in a huff; and next time we meet, which was to-night, he walks straight up to me, and says, 'go to the devil!' that's the sort of behavior my mother complains of. i want to know, what does it mean?"
Match 291: "it means, i should say, that he finds you chilly and unsympathetic."
Match 292: "it's time i jumped into a cab and hid myself in my own house,"
Match 293: "would your mother object to my being seen with you? no one could possibly recognize us, could they?"
Match 294: "you may laugh, katharine, but i can tell you that if any of your friends saw us together at this time of night they would talk about it, and i should find that very disagreeable. but why do you laugh?"
Match 295: "i don't know. because you're such a queer mixture, i think. you're half poet and half old maid."
Match 296: "i know i always seem to you highly ridiculous. but i can't help having inherited certain traditions and trying to put them into practice."
Match 297: "nonsense, william. you may come of the oldest family in devonshire, but that's no reason why you should mind being seen alone with me on the embankment."
Match 298: "i'm ten years older than you are, katharine, and i know more of the world than you do."
Match 299: "very well. leave me and go home."
Match 300: "don't call that cab for me, william. i shall walk."
Match 301: "nonsense, katharine; you'll do nothing of the kind. it's nearly twelve o'clock, and we've walked too far as it is."
Match 302: "now, william,"
Match 303: "if people see me racing along the embankment like this they will talk. you had far better say good-night, if you don't want people to talk."
Match 304: "don't let the man see us struggling, for god's sake!"
Match 305: "there's more of the old maid in you than the poet,"
Match 306: "of all the unreasonable, inconsiderate creatures i've ever known, she's the worst!"
Match 307: "heaven forbid that i should ever make a fool of myself with her again. why, i'd sooner marry the daughter of my landlady than katharine hilbery! she'd leave me not a moment's peace--and she'd never understand me--never, never, never!"
Match 308: "ha!"
Match 309: "you do well, denham,"
Match 310: "to have nothing to do with young women. i offer you my experience--if one trusts them one invariably has cause to repent. not that i have any reason at this moment,"
Match 311: "to complain of them. it's a subject that crops up now and again for no particular reason. miss datchet, i dare say, is one of the exceptions. do you like miss datchet?"
Match 312: "yes, i like mary; i don't see how one could help liking her,"
Match 313: "ah, denham, you're so different from me. you never give yourself away. i watched you this evening with katharine hilbery. my instinct is to trust the person i'm talking to. that's why i'm always being taken in, i suppose."
Match 314: "who's taken you in now?"
Match 315: "katharine hilbery?"
Match 316: "katharine hilbery,"
Match 317: "no, denham, i have no illusions about that young woman. i think i made that plain to her to-night. but don't run away with a false impression,"
Match 318: "you must not think that i have any bitterness against her--far from it. it's not altogether her fault, poor girl. she lives, you know, one of those odious, self-centered lives--at least, i think them odious for a woman--feeding her wits upon everything, having control of everything, getting far too much her own way at home--spoilt, in a sense, feeling that every one is at her feet, and so not realizing how she hurts--that is, how rudely she behaves to people who haven't all her advantages. still, to do her justice, she's no fool,"
Match 319: "she has taste. she has sense. she can understand you when you talk to her. but she's a woman, and there's an end of it,"
Match 320: "and did you tell her all this to-night?"
Match 321: "oh dear me, no. i should never think of telling katharine the truth about herself. that wouldn't do at all. one has to be in an attitude of adoration in order to get on with katharine."
Match 322: "now i've learnt that she's refused to marry him why don't i go home?"
Match 323: "you're a slave like me, i suppose?"
Match 324: "a solicitor, yes."
Match 325: "i sometimes wonder why we don't chuck it. why don't you emigrate, denham? i should have thought that would suit you."
Match 326: "i've a family."
Match 327: "i'm often on the point of going myself. and then i know i couldn't live without this"
Match 328: "there are one or two people i'm fond of, and there's a little good music, and a few pictures, now and then--just enough to keep one dangling about here. ah, but i couldn't live with savages! are you fond of books? music? pictures? d'you care at all for first editions? i've got a few nice things up here, things i pick up cheap, for i can't afford to give what they ask."
Match 329: "oh dear me, what a waste of time! but it's over now, and so we may think no more about it."
Match 330: "the baskerville congreve,"
Match 331: "i couldn't read him in a cheap edition."
Match 332: "don giovanni"
Match 333: "well, rodney,"
Match 334: "this is all very nice and comfortable."
Match 335: "tolerable,"
Match 336: "but i dare say it's just as well that you have to earn your own living."
Match 337: "if you mean that i shouldn't do anything good with leisure if i had it, i dare say you're right. but i should be ten times as happy with my whole day to spend as i liked."
Match 338: "i doubt that,"
Match 339: "i could spend three hours every day reading shakespeare,"
Match 340: "and there's music and pictures, let alone the society of the people one likes."
Match 341: "you'd be bored to death in a year's time."
Match 342: "oh, i grant you i should be bored if i did nothing. but i should write plays."
Match 343: "h'm!"
Match 344: "i should write plays,"
Match 345: "i've written three-quarters of one already, and i'm only waiting for a holiday to finish it. and it's not bad--no, some of it's really rather nice."
Match 346: "well,... will you let me see the play?"
Match 347: "do you really care for this kind of thing?"
Match 348: "very few people care for poetry. i dare say it bores you."
Match 349: "perhaps,"
Match 350: "well, i'll lend it you,"
Match 351: "urn burial,"
Match 352: "hydriotaphia,"
Match 353: "garden of cyrus,"
Match 354: "i shall look in again some time,"
Match 355: "if you like."
Match 356: "the bare branches against the sky do one so much good,"
Match 357: "but one can't lunch off trees, sally,"
Match 358: "i confess i don't know how you manage it, miss datchet,"
Match 359: "i should sleep all the afternoon, i know, if i took a heavy meal in the middle of the day."
Match 360: "what's the very latest thing in literature?"
Match 361: "eleanor, come and sit by me,"
Match 362: "i am in love with you"
Match 363: "for,"
Match 364: "the wonderful thing about you is that you're ready for anything; you're not in the least conventional, like most clever men."
Match 365: "that is what you can do,"
Match 366: "you always make people do what you want."
Match 367: "i am in love with you,"
Match 368: "quite splendid"
Match 369: "really too bad for words."
Match 370: "no. the s.g.s.--top floor."
Match 371: "you!"
Match 372: "we thought you were the printer."
Match 373: "no, mr. clacton, it's not penningtons. i should ring them up again--double three double eight, central. well, this is a surprise. come in,"
Match 374: "you're just in time for tea."
Match 375: "it was very clever of you to find your way,"
Match 376: "always the way, always the way,"
Match 377: "kit markham is the only person who knows how to deal with the thing."
Match 378: "if we had known miss hilbery was coming, we should have bought a cake,"
Match 379: "salford's affiliated,"
Match 380: "well done, salford!"
Match 381: "yes, these provincial centers seem to be coming into line at last,"
Match 382: "in our work."
Match 383: "and the proofs still not come?"
Match 384: "it's too bad--too bad. at this rate we shall miss the country post. which reminds me, mr. clacton, don't you think we should circularize the provinces with partridge's last speech? what? you've not read it? oh, it's the best thing they've had in the house this session. even the prime minister--"
Match 385: "we don't allow shop at tea, sally,"
Match 386: "we fine her a penny each time she forgets, and the fines go to buying a plum cake,"
Match 387: "i'm sorry, i'm sorry,"
Match 388: "it's my misfortune to be an enthusiast,"
Match 389: "my father's daughter could hardly be anything else. i think i've been on as many committees as most people. waifs and strays, rescue work, church work, c. o. s.--local branch--besides the usual civic duties which fall to one as a householder. but i've given them all up for our work here, and i don't regret it for a second,"
Match 390: "this is the root question, i feel; until women have votes--"
Match 391: "it'll be sixpence, at least, sally,"
Match 392: "and we're all sick to death of women and their votes."
Match 393: "tut-tut-tut"
Match 394: "she's doing more for the cause than any of us. she's giving her youth--for, alas! when i was young there were domestic circumstances--"
Match 395: "yes, i took my little bag into the square,"
Match 396: "it was really very sustaining, and the bare boughs against the sky do one so much good. but i shall have to give up going into the square,"
Match 397: "the injustice of it! why should i have a beautiful square all to myself, when poor women who need rest have nowhere at all to sit?"
Match 398: "it's dreadful what a tyrant one still is, in spite of all one's efforts. one tries to lead a decent life, but one can't. of course, directly one thinks of it, one sees that all squares should be open to every one. is there any society with that object, mr. clacton? if not, there should be, surely."
Match 399: "a most excellent object,"
Match 400: "at the same time, one must deplore the ramification of organizations, mrs. seal. so much excellent effort thrown away, not to speak of pounds, shillings, and pence. now how many organizations of a philanthropic nature do you suppose there are in the city of london itself, miss hilbery?"
Match 401: "well, there are more in this house than i'd any notion of,"
Match 402: "on the ground floor you protect natives, on the next you emigrate women and tell people to eat nuts--"
Match 403: "why do you say that 'we' do these things?"
Match 404: "we're not responsible for all the cranks who choose to lodge in the same house with us."
Match 405: "you don't belong to our society, then?"
Match 406: "no, i'm afraid i don't,"
Match 407: "but surely,"
Match 408: "mrs. seal is an enthusiast in these matters,"
Match 409: "we have to remind her sometimes that others have a right to their views even if they differ from our own.... "
Match 410: " has a very funny picture this week, about a suffragist and an agricultural laborer. have you seen this week's "
Match 411: " miss datchet?"
Match 412: "no."
Match 413: "but surely, if you care about the welfare of your sex at all, you must wish them to have the vote?"
Match 414: "i never said i didn't wish them to have the vote,"
Match 415: "then why aren't you a member of our society?"
Match 416: "are you in any way related, i wonder, to the poet alardyce? his daughter, i believe, married a mr. hilbery."
Match 417: "yes; i'm the poet's granddaughter,"
Match 418: "the poet's granddaughter!"
Match 419: "ah, indeed. that interests me very much,"
Match 420: "i owe a great debt to your grandfather, miss hilbery. at one time i could have repeated the greater part of him by heart. but one gets out of the way of reading poetry, unfortunately. you don't remember him, i suppose?"
Match 421: "the proofs at last!"
Match 422: "oh, it's only mr. denham!"
Match 423: "katharine has come to see how one runs an office."
Match 424: "i hope mary hasn't persuaded you that she knows how to run an office?"
Match 425: "what, doesn't she?"
Match 426: "now, i know what you're going to say, mr. denham! but it was the day kit markham was here, and she upsets one so--with her wonderful vitality, always thinking of something new that we ought to be doing and aren't--and i was conscious at the time that my dates were mixed. it had nothing to do with mary at all, i assure you."
Match 427: "my dear sally, don't apologize,"
Match 428: "men are such pedants--they don't know what things matter, and what things don't."
Match 429: "now, denham, speak up for our sex,"
Match 430: "a mere man."
Match 431: "doesn't it seem strange to you, miss hilbery,"
Match 432: "that the french, with all their wealth of illustrious names, have no poet who can compare with your grandfather? let me see. there's chenier and hugo and alfred de musset--wonderful men, but, at the same time, there's a richness, a freshness about alardyce--"
Match 433: "for if i were to tell you what i know of back-stairs intrigue, and what can be done by the power of the purse, you wouldn't credit me, mr. denham, you wouldn't, indeed. which is why i feel that the only work for my father's daughter--for he was one of the pioneers, mr. denham, and on his tombstone i had that verse from the psalms put, about the sowers and the seed.... and what wouldn't i give that he should be alive now, seeing what we're going to see--"
Match 434: "the standard of morality seems to me frightfully low,"
Match 435: "especially among women who aren't well educated. they don't see that small things matter, and that's where the leakage begins, and then we find ourselves in difficulties--i very nearly lost my temper yesterday,"
Match 436: "it makes me very angry when people tell me lies--doesn't it make you angry?"
Match 437: "but considering that every one tells lies,"
Match 438: "i don't think that i tell lies, and i don't think that ralph tells lies, do you, ralph?"
Match 439: "mary datchet does that sort of work very well.... she's responsible for it, i suppose?"
Match 440: "yes. the others don't help at all.... has she made a convert of you?"
Match 441: "oh no. that is, i'm a convert already."
Match 442: "but she hasn't persuaded you to work for them?"
Match 443: "oh dear no--that wouldn't do at all."
Match 444: "suppose we get on to that omnibus?"
Match 445: "but which way are you going?"
Match 446: "i'm going to the temple,"
Match 447: "this is like venice,"
Match 448: "the motor-cars, i mean, shooting about so quickly, with their lights."
Match 449: "i've never seen venice,"
Match 450: "i keep that and some other things for my old age."
Match 451: "what are the other things?"
Match 452: "there's venice and india and, i think, dante, too."
Match 453: "think of providing for one's old age! and would you refuse to see venice if you had the chance?"
Match 454: "i've planned out my life in sections ever since i was a child, to make it last longer. you see, i'm always afraid that i'm missing something--"
Match 455: "and so am i!"
Match 456: "but, after all,"
Match 457: "why should you miss anything?"
Match 458: "why? because i'm poor, for one thing,"
Match 459: "you, i suppose, can have venice and india and dante every day of your life."
Match 460: "but to know that one might have things doesn't alter the fact that one hasn't got them,"
Match 461: "how could i go to india, for example? besides,"
Match 462: "i have a message to give your father,"
Match 463: "perhaps you would give it him, or i could come--"
Match 464: "yes, do come,"
Match 465: "still, i don't see why you shouldn't go to india,"
Match 466: "and little augustus pelham said to me, 'it's the younger generation knocking at the door,' and i said to him, 'oh, but the younger generation comes in without knocking, mr. pelham.' such a feeble little joke, wasn't it, but down it went into his notebook all the same."
Match 467: "let us congratulate ourselves that we shall be in the grave before that work is published,"
Match 468: "the only excuse for you, katharine, is that dinner is still later than you are,"
Match 469: "i don't mind her being late when the result is so charming,"
Match 470: "still, i don't know that i like your being out so late, katharine,"
Match 471: "you took a cab, i hope?"
Match 472: "that's more cheerful,"
Match 473: "d'you know, katharine, that ridiculous goose came to tea with me? oh, how i wanted you! he tried to make epigrams all the time, and i got so nervous, expecting them, you know, that i spilt the tea--and he made an epigram about that!"
Match 474: "which ridiculous goose?"
Match 475: "only one of my geese, happily, makes epigrams--augustus pelham, of course,"
Match 476: "i'm not sorry that i was out,"
Match 477: "poor augustus!"
Match 478: "but we're all too hard on him. remember how devoted he is to his tiresome old mother."
Match 479: "that's only because she is his mother. any one connected with himself--"
Match 480: "no, no, katharine--that's too bad. that's--what's the word i mean, trevor, something long and latin--the sort of word you and katharine know--"
Match 481: "cynical."
Match 482: "well, that'll do. i don't believe in sending girls to college, but i should teach them that sort of thing. it makes one feel so dignified, bringing out these little allusions, and passing on gracefully to the next topic. but i don't know what's come over me--i actually had to ask augustus the name of the lady hamlet was in love with, as you were out, katharine, and heaven knows what he mayn't put down about me in his diary."
Match 483: "i wish,"
Match 484: "what is it you wish?"
Match 485: "i wish mother wasn't famous. i was out at tea, and they would talk to me about poetry."
Match 486: "thinking you must be poetical, i see--and aren't you?"
Match 487: "who's been talking to you about poetry, katharine?"
Match 488: "they have an office at the top of one of the old houses in russell square. i never saw such queer-looking people. and the man discovered i was related to the poet, and talked to me about poetry. even mary datchet seems different in that atmosphere."
Match 489: "yes, the office atmosphere is very bad for the soul,"
Match 490: "i don't remember any offices in russell square in the old days, when mamma lived there,"
Match 491: "and i can't fancy turning one of those noble great rooms into a stuffy little suffrage office. still, if the clerks read poetry there must be something nice about them."
Match 492: "no, because they don't read it as we read it,"
Match 493: "but it's nice to think of them reading your grandfather, and not filling up those dreadful little forms all day long,"
Match 494: "at any rate, they haven't made a convert of katharine, which was what i was afraid of,"
Match 495: "oh no,"
Match 496: "i wouldn't work with them for anything."
Match 497: "it's curious,"
Match 498: "how the sight of one's fellow-enthusiasts always chokes one off. they show up the faults of one's cause so much more plainly than one's antagonists. one can be enthusiastic in one's study, but directly one comes into touch with the people who agree with one, all the glamor goes. so i've always found,"
Match 499: "oh, katharine,"
Match 500: "how you've made me think of mamma and the old days in russell square! i can see the chandeliers, and the green silk of the piano, and mamma sitting in her cashmere shawl by the window, singing till the little ragamuffin boys outside stopped to listen. papa sent me in with a bunch of violets while he waited round the corner. it must have been a summer evening. that was before things were hopeless...."
Match 501: "if they'd lived now,"
Match 502: "i feel it wouldn't have happened. people aren't so set upon tragedy as they were then. if my father had been able to go round the world, or if she'd had a rest cure, everything would have come right. but what could i do? and then they had bad friends, both of them, who made mischief. ah, katharine, when you marry, be quite, quite sure that you love your husband!"
Match 503: "now this is what mary datchet and mr. denham don't understand. this is the sort of position i'm always getting into. how simple it must be to live as they do!"
Match 504: "but, katharine,"
Match 505: "though, heaven knows, i don't want to see you married, surely if ever a man loved a woman, william loves you. and it's a nice, rich-sounding name too--katharine rodney, which, unfortunately, doesn't mean that he's got any money, because he hasn't."
Match 506: "it's very dull that you can only marry one husband, certainly,"
Match 507: "i always wish that you could marry everybody who wants to marry you. perhaps they'll come to that in time, but meanwhile i confess that dear william--"
Match 508: "please, katharine, read us something real."
Match 509: "remember,"
Match 510: "that he bears your grandfather's name, and so will the child that is to be born. the poor boy is not so much to blame as the woman who deluded him, thinking him a gentleman, which he is, and having money, which he has not."
Match 511: "what would ralph denham say to this?"
Match 512: "what would mary datchet and ralph denham say?"
Match 513: "of"
Match 514: "and,"
Match 515: "nag's head"
Match 516: "turkish knight,"
Match 517: "isabella and the pot of basil,"
Match 518: "i've had a letter from aunt celia about cyril, father.... it seems to be true--about his marriage. what are we to do?"
Match 519: "cyril seems to have been behaving in a very foolish manner,"
Match 520: "he's about done for himself, i should say,"
Match 521: "humph!"
Match 522: "mother knows nothing about it,"
Match 523: "will you tell her?"
Match 524: "i shall tell your mother. but i shall tell her that there is nothing whatever for us to do."
Match 525: "but the marriage?"
Match 526: "what in the name of conscience did he do it for?"
Match 527: "ibsen and butler.... he has sent me a letter full of quotations--nonsense, though clever nonsense."
Match 528: "well, if the younger generation want to carry on its life on those lines, it's none of our affair,"
Match 529: "but isn't it our affair, perhaps, to make them get married?"
Match 530: "why the dickens should they apply to me?"
Match 531: "only as the head of the family--"
Match 532: "but i'm not the head of the family. alfred's the head of the family. let them apply to alfred,"
Match 533: "i think, perhaps, the best thing would be for me to go and see them,"
Match 534: "i won't have you going anywhere near them,"
Match 535: "indeed, i don't understand why they've dragged you into the business at all--i don't see that it's got anything to do with you."
Match 536: "i've always been friends with cyril,"
Match 537: "but did he ever tell you anything about this?"
Match 538: "as to your mother,"
Match 539: "you had better tell her the facts. she'd better know the facts before every one begins to talk about it, though why aunt celia thinks it necessary to come, i'm sure i don't know. and the less talk there is the better."
Match 540: "have you told mother?"
Match 541: "my dear child, it went out of my head."
Match 542: "i'll send a note round from the office.... i'm late this morning, and i've any amount of proofs to get through."
Match 543: "that wouldn't do at all,"
Match 544: "she must be told--you or i must tell her. we ought to have told her at first."
Match 545: "katharine,"
Match 546: "i've just made out such a queer, strange thing about your grandfather. i'm three years and six months older than he was when he died. i couldn't very well have been his mother, but i might have been his elder sister, and that seems to me such a pleasant fancy. i'm going to start quite fresh this morning, and get a lot done."
Match 547: "i really believe i'm bewitched! i only want three sentences, you see, something quite straightforward and commonplace, and i can't find 'em."
Match 548: "besides,"
Match 549: "i don't believe this'll do. did your grandfather ever visit the hebrides, katharine?"
Match 550: "my mind got running on the hebrides, and i couldn't help writing a little description of them. perhaps it would do at the beginning of a chapter. chapters often begin quite differently from the way they go on, you know."
Match 551: "it's very beautiful,"
Match 552: "but, you see, mother, we ought to go from point to point--"
Match 553: "oh, i know,"
Match 554: "and that's just what i can't do. things keep coming into my head. it isn't that i don't know everything and feel everything (who did know him, if i didn't?), but i can't put it down, you see. there's a kind of blind spot,"
Match 555: "there. and when i can't sleep o' nights, i fancy i shall die without having done it."
Match 556: "surely, katharine,"
Match 557: "the men were far handsomer in those days than they are now, in spite of their odious whiskers? look at old john graham, in his white waistcoat--look at uncle harley. that's peter the manservant, i suppose. uncle john brought him back from india."
Match 558: "what is nobler,"
Match 559: "than to be a woman to whom every one turns, in sorrow or difficulty? how have the young women of your generation improved upon that, katharine? i can see them now, sweeping over the lawns at melbury house, in their flounces and furbelows, so calm and stately and imperial (and the monkey and the little black dwarf following behind), as if nothing mattered in the world but to be beautiful and kind. but they did more than we do, i sometimes think. they were, and that's better than doing. they seem to me like ships, like majestic ships, holding on their way, not shoving or pushing, not fretted by little things, as we are, but taking their way, like ships with white sails."
Match 560: "that's janie mannering,"
Match 561: "i must have told you how she found her cook drunk under the kitchen table when the empress was coming to dinner, and tucked up her velvet sleeves (she always dressed like an empress herself), cooked the whole meal, and appeared in the drawing-room as if she'd been sleeping on a bank of roses all day. she could do anything with her hands--they all could--make a cottage or embroider a petticoat."
Match 562: "and that's queenie colquhoun,"
Match 563: "who took her coffin out with her to jamaica, packed with lovely shawls and bonnets, because you couldn't get coffins in jamaica, and she had a horror of dying there (as she did), and being devoured by the white ants. and there's sabine, the loveliest of them all; ah! it was like a star rising when she came into the room. and that's miriam, in her coachman's cloak, with all the little capes on, and she wore great top-boots underneath. you young people may say you're unconventional, but you're nothing compared with her."
Match 564: "ah, you wretch!"
Match 565: "what a wicked old despot you were, in your day! how we all bowed down before you! 'maggie,' she used to say, 'if it hadn't been for me, where would you be now?' and it was true; she brought them together, you know. she said to my father, 'marry her,' and he did; and she said to poor little clara, 'fall down and worship him,' and she did; but she got up again, of course. what else could one expect? she was a mere child--eighteen--and half dead with fright, too. but that old tyrant never repented. she used to say that she had given them three perfect months, and no one had a right to more; and i sometimes think, katharine, that's true, you know. it's more than most of us have, only we have to pretend, which was a thing neither of them could ever do. i fancy,"
Match 566: "that there was a kind of sincerity in those days between men and women which, with all your outspokenness, you haven't got."
Match 567: "they must have been good friends at heart,"
Match 568: "because she used to sing his songs. ah, how did it go?"
Match 569: "it's the vitality of them!"
Match 570: "that's what we haven't got! we're virtuous, we're earnest, we go to meetings, we pay the poor their wages, but we don't live as they lived. as often as not, my father wasn't in bed three nights out of the seven, but always fresh as paint in the morning. i hear him now, come singing up the stairs to the nursery, and tossing the loaf for breakfast on his sword-stick, and then off we went for a day's pleasuring--richmond, hampton court, the surrey hills. why shouldn't we go, katharine? it's going to be a fine day."
Match 571: "aunt celia!"
Match 572: "i think aunt celia has come to talk about cyril, mother,"
Match 573: "aunt celia has discovered that cyril is married. he has a wife and children."
Match 574: "no, he is not married,"
Match 575: "he has two children, and another on the way."
Match 576: "we thought it better to wait until it was proved before we told you,"
Match 577: "but i met cyril only a fortnight ago at the national gallery!"
Match 578: "i don't believe a word of it,"
Match 579: "i didn't wish to believe it, maggie,"
Match 580: "for a long time i couldn't believe it. but now i've seen, and i have to believe it."
Match 581: "katharine,"
Match 582: "does your father know of this?"
Match 583: "cyril married!"
Match 584: "and never telling us a word, though we've had him in our house since he was a child--noble william's son! i can't believe my ears!"
Match 585: "i have suspected for some time that he was not happy. there were new lines on his face. so i went to his rooms, when i knew he was engaged at the poor men's college. he lectures there--roman law, you know, or it may be greek. the landlady said mr. alardyce only slept there about once a fortnight now. he looked so ill, she said. she had seen him with a young person. i suspected something directly. i went to his room, and there was an envelope on the mantelpiece, and a letter with an address in seton street, off the kennington road."
Match 586: "i went to seton street,"
Match 587: "a very low place--lodging-houses, you know, with canaries in the window. number seven just like all the others. i rang, i knocked; no one came. i went down the area. i am certain i saw some one inside--children--a cradle. but no reply--no reply."
Match 588: "i stood in the street,"
Match 589: "in case i could catch a sight of one of them. it seemed a very long time. there were rough men singing in the public-house round the corner. at last the door opened, and some one--it must have been the woman herself--came right past me. there was only the pillar-box between us."
Match 590: "and what did she look like?"
Match 591: "one could see how the poor boy had been deluded,"
Match 592: "poor thing!"
Match 593: "poor cyril!"
Match 594: "but they've got nothing to live upon,"
Match 595: "if he'd come to us like a man,"
Match 596: "and said, 'i've been a fool,' one would have pitied him; one would have tried to help him. there's nothing so disgraceful after all--but he's been going about all these years, pretending, letting one take it for granted, that he was single. and the poor deserted little wife--"
Match 597: "she is not his wife,"
Match 598: "i've never heard anything so detestable!"
Match 599: "we must realize cyril's point of view first,"
Match 600: "made a life for herself,"
Match 601: "this unhappy business,"
Match 602: "if the train had not gone out of the station just as i arrived, i should have been with you before. celia has doubtless told you. you will agree with me, maggie. he must be made to marry her at once for the sake of the children--"
Match 603: "but does he refuse to marry her?"
Match 604: "he has written an absurd perverted letter, all quotations,"
Match 605: "he thinks he's doing a very fine thing, where we only see the folly of it.... the girl's every bit as infatuated as he is--for which i blame him."
Match 606: "she entangled him,"
Match 607: "it's no use going into the rights and wrongs of the affair now, celia,"
Match 608: "the mischief's done, and very ugly mischief too. are we to allow the third child to be born out of wedlock? (i am sorry to have to say these things before you, katharine.) he will bear your name, maggie--your father's name, remember."
Match 609: "but let us hope it will be a girl,"
Match 610: "it's detestable--quite detestable!"
Match 611: "nowadays, people don't think so badly of these things as they used to do,"
Match 612: "it will be horribly uncomfortable for them sometimes, but if they are brave, clever children, as they will be, i dare say it'll make remarkable people of them in the end. robert browning used to say that every great man has jewish blood in him, and we must try to look at it in that light. and, after all, cyril has acted on principle. one may disagree with his principle, but, at least, one can respect it--like the french revolution, or cromwell cutting the king's head off. some of the most terrible things in history have been done on principle,"
Match 613: "i'm afraid i take a very different view of principle,"
Match 614: "principle!"
Match 615: "i will go to-morrow and see him,"
Match 616: "but why should you take these disagreeable things upon yourself, celia?"
Match 617: "perhaps it would be better if i married william,"
Match 618: "it's life that matters, nothing but life--the process of discovering--the everlasting and perpetual process, not the discovery itself at all."
Match 619: "now,"
Match 620: "i'm not going to let these silly ideas come into my head.... don't you think mr. asquith deserves to be hanged?"
Match 621: "how absurd mary would think me if she knew that i almost made up my mind to walk all the way to chelsea in order to look at katharine's windows. she wouldn't understand it, but i like her very much as she is."
Match 622: "here,"
Match 623: "is where we differ from women; they have no sense of romance."
Match 624: "well, mary,"
Match 625: "why don't you say something amusing?"
Match 626: "because i've got nothing amusing to say, i suppose."
Match 627: "you work too hard. i don't mean your health,"
Match 628: "i mean that you seem to me to be getting wrapped up in your work."
Match 629: "and is that a bad thing?"
Match 630: "i think it is,"
Match 631: "but only a week ago you were saying the opposite."
Match 632: "you don't read enough, mary,"
Match 633: "you ought to read more poetry."
Match 634: "i'm behaving exactly as i said i wouldn't behave,"
Match 635: "tell me what i ought to read, then."
Match 636: "you live with your inferiors,"
Match 637: "and you get into a groove because, on the whole, it's rather a pleasant groove. and you tend to forget what you're there for. you've the feminine habit of making much of details. you don't see when things matter and when they don't. and that's what's the ruin of all these organizations. that's why the suffragists have never done anything all these years. what's the point of drawing-room meetings and bazaars? you want to have ideas, mary; get hold of something big; never mind making mistakes, but don't niggle. why don't you throw it all up for a year, and travel?--see something of the world. don't be content to live with half a dozen people in a backwater all your life. but you won't,"
Match 638: "i've rather come to that way of thinking myself--about myself, i mean,"
Match 639: "i should like to go somewhere far away."
Match 640: "but look here, mary, you haven't been taking this seriously, have you?"
Match 641: "you won't go away, will you?"
Match 642: "oh no, don't go away."
Match 643: "i don't know exactly what i mean to do,"
Match 644: "it's life that matters, nothing but life--the process of discovering, the everlasting and perpetual process,"
Match 645: "not the discovery itself at all."
Match 646: "well, william,"
Match 647: "i'm afraid i'm late."
Match 648: "i like your sonnet very much."
Match 649: "my oysters! i had a basket,"
Match 650: "and i've left it somewhere. uncle dudley dines with us to-night. what in the world have i done with them?"
Match 651: "oysters, oysters--your basket of oysters!"
Match 652: "i had them,"
Match 653: "in the strand; i sat on a seat. well, never mind,"
Match 654: "i dare say some old creature is enjoying them by this time."
Match 655: "i should have thought that you never forgot anything,"
Match 656: "that's part of the myth about me, i know,"
Match 657: "and i wonder,"
Match 658: "what the truth about you is? but i know this sort of thing doesn't interest you,"
Match 659: "no; it doesn't interest me very much,"
Match 660: "what shall we talk about then?"
Match 661: "however we start, we end by talking about the same thing--about poetry, i mean. i wonder if you realize, william, that i've never read even shakespeare? it's rather wonderful how i've kept it up all these years."
Match 662: "you've kept it up for ten years very beautifully, as far as i'm concerned,"
Match 663: "ten years? so long as that?"
Match 664: "and i don't think it's always bored you,"
Match 665: "you may say you don't read books,"
Match 666: "but, all the same, you know about them. besides, who wants you to be learned? leave that to the poor devils who've got nothing better to do. you--you--ahem!--"
Match 667: "well, then, why don't you read me something before i go?"
Match 668: "katharine, you've only just come! let me see now, what have i got to show you?"
Match 669: "i believe you only ask me to read out of kindness,"
Match 670: "let's find something else to talk about. who have you been seeing?"
Match 671: "i don't generally ask things out of kindness,"
Match 672: "however, if you don't want to read, you needn't."
Match 673: "one can trust you, certainly, to say unpleasant things,"
Match 674: "ahem! the princess is lost in the wood, and she hears the sound of a horn. (this would all be very pretty on the stage, but i can't get the effect here.) anyhow, sylvano enters, accompanied by the rest of the gentlemen of gratian's court. i begin where he soliloquizes."
Match 675: "that seems to me extremely well written, william; although, of course, i don't know enough to criticize in detail."
Match 676: "but it's the skill that strikes you--not the emotion?"
Match 677: "in a fragment like that, of course, the skill strikes one most."
Match 678: "but perhaps--have you time to listen to one more short piece? the scene between the lovers? there's some real feeling in that, i think. denham agrees that it's the best thing i've done."
Match 679: "you've read it to ralph denham?"
Match 680: "he's a better judge than i am. what did he say?"
Match 681: "my dear katharine,"
Match 682: "i don't ask you for criticism, as i should ask a scholar. i dare say there are only five men in england whose opinion of my work matters a straw to me. but i trust you where feeling is concerned. i had you in my mind often when i was writing those scenes. i kept asking myself, 'now is this the sort of thing katharine would like?' i always think of you when i'm writing, katharine, even when it's the sort of thing you wouldn't know about. and i'd rather--yes, i really believe i'd rather--you thought well of my writing than any one in the world."
Match 683: "you think too much of me altogether, william,"
Match 684: "no, katharine, i don't,"
Match 685: "it does me good to think of you."
Match 686: "william,"
Match 687: "william,"
Match 688: "if you still want me to marry you, i will."
Match 689: "... how stupid of me to forget the name in my telegram. such a nice, rich, english name, too, and, in addition, he has all the graces of intellect; he has read literally everything. i tell katharine, i shall always put him on my right side at dinner, so as to have him by me when people begin talking about characters in shakespeare. they won't be rich, but they'll be very, very happy. i was sitting in my room late one night, feeling that nothing nice would ever happen to me again, when i heard katharine outside in the passage, and i thought to myself, 'shall i call her in?' and then i thought (in that hopeless, dreary way one does think, with the fire going out and one's birthday just over), 'why should i lay my troubles on her?' but my little self-control had its reward, for next moment she tapped at the door and came in, and sat on the rug, and though we neither of us said anything, i felt so happy all of a second that i couldn't help crying, 'oh, katharine, when you come to my age, how i hope you'll have a daughter, too!' you know how silent katharine is. she was so silent, for such a long time, that in my foolish, nervous state i dreaded something, i don't quite know what. and then she told me how, after all, she had made up her mind. she had written. she expected him to-morrow. at first i wasn't glad at all. i didn't want her to marry any one; but when she said, 'it will make no difference. i shall always care for you and father most,' then i saw how selfish i was, and i told her she must give him everything, everything, everything! i told her i should be thankful to come second. but why, when everything's turned out just as one always hoped it would turn out, why then can one do nothing but cry, nothing but feel a desolate old woman whose life's been a failure, and now is nearly over, and age is so cruel? but katharine said to me, 'i am happy. i'm very happy.' and then i thought, though it all seemed so desperately dismal at the time, katharine had said she was happy, and i should have a son, and it would all turn out so much more wonderfully than i could possibly imagine, for though the sermons don't say so, i do believe the world is meant for us to be happy in. she told me that they would live quite near us, and see us every day; and she would go on with the life, and we should finish it as we had meant to. and, after all, it would be far more horrid if she didn't marry--or suppose she married some one we couldn't endure? suppose she had fallen in love with some one who was married already?  "
Match 690: "one doesn't know any more, does one? one hasn't any advice to give one's children. one can only hope that they will have the same vision and the same power to believe, without which life would be so meaningless. that is what i ask for katharine and her husband."
Match 691: "is mr. hilbery at home, or mrs. hilbery?"
Match 692: "no, sir. but miss hilbery is at home,"
Match 693: "my father is out,"
Match 694: "but if you can wait, i expect him soon."
Match 695: "is that one of the moderns whom you despise?"
Match 696: "yes,"
Match 697: "i think even you would despise him."
Match 698: "even i?"
Match 699: "why even i?"
Match 700: "you said you liked modern things; i said i hated them."
Match 701: "or did i confess that i hated all books?"
Match 702: "i forget--"
Match 703: "do you hate all books?"
Match 704: "it would be absurd to say that i hate all books when i've only read ten, perhaps; but--' here she pulled herself up short.  "
Match 705: "  "
Match 706: " she continued. "
Match 707: "  she cut a cake vigorously into slices, and providing a tray with bread and butter for mrs. hilbery, who was in her room with a cold, she rose to go upstairs.  ralph held the door open for her, and then stood with clasped hands in the middle of the room. his eyes were bright, and, indeed, he scarcely knew whether they beheld dreams or realities. all down the street and on the doorstep, and while he mounted the stairs, his dream of katharine possessed him; on the threshold of the room he had dismissed it, in order to prevent too painful a collision between what he dreamt of her and what she was. and in five minutes she had filled the shell of the old dream with the flesh of life; looked with fire out of phantom eyes. he glanced about him with bewilderment at finding himself among her chairs and tables; they were solid, for he grasped the back of the chair in which katharine had sat; and yet they were unreal; the atmosphere was that of a dream. he summoned all the faculties of his spirit to seize what the minutes had to give him; and from the depths of his mind there rose unchecked a joyful recognition of the truth that human nature surpasses, in its beauty, all that our wildest dreams bring us hints of.  katharine came into the room a moment later. he stood watching her come towards him, and thought her more beautiful and strange than his dream of her; for the real katharine could speak the words which seemed to crowd behind the forehead and in the depths of the eyes, and the commonest sentence would be flashed on by this immortal light. and she overflowed the edges of the dream; he remarked that her softness was like that of some vast snowy owl; she wore a ruby on her finger.  "
Match 708: " she said, "
Match 709: " she went on. "
Match 710: "  "
Match 711: " said ralph.  "
Match 712: " she inquired, turning upon him with a laugh.  "
Match 713: "  "
Match 714: " she said, searching him for proof of this apparently, with eyes now almost impersonally direct. it would be easy, ralph thought, to worship one so far removed, and yet of so straight a nature; easy to submit recklessly to her, without thought of future pain.  "
Match 715: " she demanded. he felt that her question had an unexplained weight of meaning behind it, as if she sought an answer to a question that she did not ask.  "
Match 716: " he replied. "
Match 717: "  "
Match 718: " she asked, almost with impatience, tapping her spoon two or three times against the side of her cup.  "
Match 719: " ralph laid hands on the first words that came to mind. "
Match 720: "  a curious change came over her face, as if the flame of her mind were subdued; and she looked at him ironically and with the expression which he had called sad before, for want of a better name for it.  "
Match 721: " she said.  "
Match 722: " he replied energetically. "
Match 723: "  she followed his words with parted lips, as though to answer eagerly when he had done; but as he said, "
Match 724: " the door of the drawing-room swung open, and so remained for a perceptible instant. they both held themselves silent, her lips still parted.  far off, they heard the rustle of skirts. then the owner of the skirts appeared in the doorway, which she almost filled, nearly concealing the figure of a very much smaller lady who accompanied her.  "
Match 725: " katharine murmured, under her breath. her tone had a hint of tragedy in it, but no less, ralph thought, than the situation required. she addressed the larger lady as aunt millicent; the smaller was aunt celia, mrs. milvain, who had lately undertaken the task of marrying cyril to his wife. both ladies, but mrs. cosham (aunt millicent) in particular, had that look of heightened, smoothed, incarnadined existence which is proper to elderly ladies paying calls in london about five o'clock in the afternoon. portraits by romney, seen through glass, have something of their pink, mellow look, their blooming softness, as of apricots hanging upon a red wall in the afternoon sun. mrs. cosham was so appareled with hanging muffs, chains, and swinging draperies that it was impossible to detect the shape of a human being in the mass of brown and black which filled the arm-chair. mrs. milvain was a much slighter figure; but the same doubt as to the precise lines of her contour filled ralph, as he regarded them, with dismal foreboding. what remark of his would ever reach these fabulous and fantastic characters?--for there was something fantastically unreal in the curious swayings and noddings of mrs. cosham, as if her equipment included a large wire spring. her voice had a high-pitched, cooing note, which prolonged words and cut them short until the english language seemed no longer fit for common purposes. in a moment of nervousness, so ralph thought, katharine had turned on innumerable electric lights. but mrs. cosham had gained impetus (perhaps her swaying movements had that end in view) for sustained speech; and she now addressed ralph deliberately and elaborately.  "
Match 726: " her rich and romantic notes were accompanied by a wave of a long white hand, which, when waved, gave off a flash of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. ralph wondered whether she more resembled an elephant, with a jeweled head-dress, or a superb cockatoo, balanced insecurely upon its perch, and pecking capriciously at a lump of sugar.  "
Match 727: " she repeated. "
Match 728: "  "
Match 729: " he replied.  "
Match 730: " she jerked in the direction of katharine. she sank her head upon her breast, as if for a moment's meditation, which past, she looked up and observed: "
Match 731: "--here she displayed both her beautiful white hands--"
Match 732: "  "
Match 733: " ralph protested, "
Match 734: "  "
Match 735: " exclaimed mrs. cosham, with a gesture of surprise and relief mingled. "
Match 736: "  here she hollowed her hand into a screen, and, leaning towards katharine, inquired, in a very audible whisper, "
Match 737: "  "
Match 738: " said katharine, with more than her usual clearness and firmness, "
Match 739: "  "
Match 740: "  "
Match 741: " mrs. milvain interposed, the frail, silvery notes of her voice falling with the sweet tone of an old bell.  "
Match 742: " she continued. "
Match 743: "  ralph shook his head, and she sighed.  "
Match 744: " she addressed katharine. "
Match 745: "  "
Match 746: " mrs. cosham ejaculated, reminiscently.  "
Match 747: "  katharine laughed. she looked at ralph. his eyes were meditative, and she wondered what he found in this old gossip to make him ponder so contentedly. she felt, she hardly knew why, a curious pity for him.  "
Match 748: " she asked, to make them go on talking, which, indeed, they needed little invitation to do.  "
Match 749: " mrs. milvain hastened to inform them. "
Match 750: " she said, turning to ralph, "
Match 751: "  "
Match 752: " mrs. cosham confirmed her, "
Match 753: " she sighed, "
Match 754: " she concluded.  "
Match 755: " mrs. milvain resumed, lowering her voice rather confidentially, "
Match 756: " she added, summing up these scattered remarks, "
Match 757: "  mrs. cosham approved of this sentiment with more ponderous sagacity from her side of the tea-table, in the first place by swaying her head, and in the second by remarking:  "
Match 758: "  "
Match 759: " said ralph good-humoredly. "
Match 760: "  "
Match 761: " mrs. cosham demanded, afraid lest she should be balked of her priceless discovery, a young man truly devoted to literature.  "
Match 762: " denham reassured her.  "
Match 763: " mrs. cosham echoed. "
Match 764: " she half closed her eyes, and indulged herself in a fascinating picture of a briefless barrister lodged in a garret, writing immortal novels by the light of a farthing dip. but the romance which fell upon the figures of great writers and illumined their pages was no false radiance in her case. she carried her pocket shakespeare about with her, and met life fortified by the words of the poets. how far she saw denham, and how far she confused him with some hero of fiction, it would be hard to say. literature had taken possession even of her memories. she was matching him, presumably, with certain characters in the old novels, for she came out, after a pause, with:  "
Match 765: " she pronounced energetically, "
Match 766: " she drew out her small, worn volume with some difficulty, opened it, and shook it in the air. "
Match 767: "  thus called upon to sum up the worth of human nature in a few words, ralph answered unhesitatingly:  "
Match 768: "  "
Match 769: "  "
Match 770: "  "
Match 771: " mrs. cosham sighed. "
Match 772: " she looked at him, and thought that there were signs of distinct power in his brow. he would do well, she thought, to devote himself to satire.  "
Match 773: " mrs. milvain interposed, rather resenting the waste of time involved in talking about fictitious people when you might be talking about real people. "
Match 774: "  "
Match 775: " said katharine, waking from other thoughts with her little start. "
Match 776: "  "
Match 777: " mrs. cosham corroborated. "
Match 778: "  "
Match 779: "  "
Match 780: " mrs. milvain continued. "
Match 781: " she went on, telling her story with charming solemnity to ralph, "
Match 782: "  "
Match 783: " said katharine.  "
Match 784: "  "
Match 785: " said mrs. cosham, rather tartly. "
Match 786: " she continued, "
Match 787: "  "
Match 788: " said katharine, with a laugh, for she liked the rashness which irritated the rest of the family. "
Match 789: "  "
Match 790: " said mrs. milvain, "
Match 791: "  "
Match 792: " said katharine.  it happened that mrs. cosham had once more produced her pocket volume of shakespeare, and was consulting ralph upon an obscure passage in "
Match 793: " he did not at once seize the meaning of what katharine and her aunt were saying; william, he supposed, referred to some small cousin, for he now saw katharine as a child in a pinafore; but, nevertheless, he was so much distracted that his eye could hardly follow the words on the paper. a moment later he heard them speak distinctly of an engagement ring.  "
Match 794: " he heard katharine say.      "
Match 795: "  mrs. cosham intoned; at the same instant "
Match 796: " fitted itself to "
Match 797: " in ralph's mind. he felt convinced that katharine was engaged to rodney. his first sensation was one of violent rage with her for having deceived him throughout the visit, fed him with pleasant old wives' tales, let him see her as a child playing in a meadow, shared her youth with him, while all the time she was a stranger entirely, and engaged to marry rodney.  but was it possible? surely it was not possible. for in his eyes she was still a child. he paused so long over the book that mrs. cosham had time to look over his shoulder and ask her niece:  "
Match 798: "  this convinced him of the truth of the monstrous idea. he looked up at once and said:  "
Match 799: "  his voice had changed so much, he spoke with such curtness and even with such contempt, that mrs. cosham looked at him fairly puzzled. happily she belonged to a generation which expected uncouthness in its men, and she merely felt convinced that this mr. denham was very, very clever. she took back her shakespeare, as denham seemed to have no more to say, and secreted it once more about her person with the infinitely pathetic resignation of the old.  "
Match 800: " she said, by way of filling in the pause; "
Match 801: " she nodded her head rather vaguely. "
Match 802: "  denham's one wish was to leave the house as soon as he could; but the elderly ladies had risen, and were proposing to visit mrs. hilbery in her bedroom, so that any move on his part was impossible. at the same time, he wished to say something, but he knew not what, to katharine alone. she took her aunts upstairs, and returned, coming towards him once more with an air of innocence and friendliness that amazed him.  "
Match 803: " she said. "
Match 804: " and she laughed, as if now they might share a perfectly friendly laugh at the tea-party.  but ralph made no attempt to seat himself.  "
Match 805: " he said. "
Match 806: " he saw her face change, but only to become graver than before.  "
Match 807: " she asked. "
Match 808: "  ralph remained standing with his hand on the back of a chair in absolute silence. abysses seemed to plunge into darkness between them. he looked at her, but her face showed that she was not thinking of him. no regret or consciousness of wrong disturbed her.  "
Match 809: " he said at length.  she seemed about to say something, then changed her mind and said merely:  "
Match 810: "--she hesitated--"
Match 811: "  he bowed and left the room.  ralph strode with extreme swiftness along the embankment. every muscle was taut and braced as if to resist some sudden attack from outside. for the moment it seemed as if the attack were about to be directed against his body, and his brain thus was on the alert, but without understanding. finding himself, after a few minutes, no longer under observation, and no attack delivered, he slackened his pace, the pain spread all through him, took possession of every governing seat, and met with scarcely any resistance from powers exhausted by their first effort at defence. he took his way languidly along the river embankment, away from home rather than towards it. the world had him at its mercy. he made no pattern out of the sights he saw. he felt himself now, as he had often fancied other people, adrift on the stream, and far removed from control of it, a man with no grasp upon circumstances any longer. old battered men loafing at the doors of public-houses now seemed to be his fellows, and he felt, as he supposed them to feel, a mingling of envy and hatred towards those who passed quickly and certainly to a goal of their own. they, too, saw things very thin and shadowy, and were wafted about by the lightest breath of wind. for the substantial world, with its prospect of avenues leading on and on to the invisible distance, had slipped from him, since katharine was engaged. now all his life was visible, and the straight, meager path had its ending soon enough. katharine was engaged, and she had deceived him, too. he felt for corners of his being untouched by his disaster; but there was no limit to the flood of damage; not one of his possessions was safe now. katharine had deceived him; she had mixed herself with every thought of his, and reft of her they seemed false thoughts which he would blush to think again. his life seemed immeasurably impoverished.  he sat himself down, in spite of the chilly fog which obscured the farther bank and left its lights suspended upon a blank surface, upon one of the riverside seats, and let the tide of disillusionment sweep through him. for the time being all bright points in his life were blotted out; all prominences leveled. at first he made himself believe that katharine had treated him badly, and drew comfort from the thought that, left alone, she would recollect this, and think of him and tender him, in silence, at any rate, an apology. but this grain of comfort failed him after a second or two, for, upon reflection, he had to admit that katharine owed him nothing. katharine had promised nothing, taken nothing; to her his dreams had meant nothing. this, indeed, was the lowest pitch of his despair. if the best of one's feelings means nothing to the person most concerned in those feelings, what reality is left us? the old romance which had warmed his days for him, the thoughts of katharine which had painted every hour, were now made to appear foolish and enfeebled. he rose, and looked into the river, whose swift race of dun-colored waters seemed the very spirit of futility and oblivion.  "
Match 812: " he thought, as he leant there. so feeble and insubstantial did he feel himself that he repeated the word aloud.  "
Match 813: "  now denham had reason to know that he could bring to birth and keep alive a fine anger when he chose. rodney provided a good target for that emotion. and yet at the moment, rodney and katharine herself seemed disembodied ghosts. he could scarcely remember the look of them. his mind plunged lower and lower. their marriage seemed of no importance to him. all things had turned to ghosts; the whole mass of the world was insubstantial vapor, surrounding the solitary spark in his mind, whose burning point he could remember, for it burnt no more. he had once cherished a belief, and katharine had embodied this belief, and she did so no longer. he did not blame her; he blamed nothing, nobody; he saw the truth. he saw the dun-colored race of waters and the blank shore. but life is vigorous; the body lives, and the body, no doubt, dictated the reflection, which now urged him to movement, that one may cast away the forms of human beings, and yet retain the passion which seemed inseparable from their existence in the flesh. now this passion burnt on his horizon, as the winter sun makes a greenish pane in the west through thinning clouds. his eyes were set on something infinitely far and remote; by that light he felt he could walk, and would, in future, have to find his way. but that was all there was left to him of a populous and teeming world.    chapter xiii  the lunch hour in the office was only partly spent by denham in the consumption of food. whether fine or wet, he passed most of it pacing the gravel paths in lincoln's inn fields. the children got to know his figure, and the sparrows expected their daily scattering of bread-crumbs. no doubt, since he often gave a copper and almost always a handful of bread, he was not as blind to his surroundings as he thought himself.  he thought that these winter days were spent in long hours before white papers radiant in electric light; and in short passages through fog-dimmed streets. when he came back to his work after lunch he carried in his head a picture of the strand, scattered with omnibuses, and of the purple shapes of leaves pressed flat upon the gravel, as if his eyes had always been bent upon the ground. his brain worked incessantly, but his thought was attended with so little joy that he did not willingly recall it; but drove ahead, now in this direction, now in that; and came home laden with dark books borrowed from a library.  mary datchet, coming from the strand at lunch-time, saw him one day taking his turn, closely buttoned in an overcoat, and so lost in thought that he might have been sitting in his own room.  she was overcome by something very like awe by the sight of him; then she felt much inclined to laugh, although her pulse beat faster. she passed him, and he never saw her. she came back and touched him on the shoulder.  "
Match 814: " he exclaimed. "
Match 815: "  "
Match 816: " she said. "
Match 817: "  "
Match 818: " ralph replied, rather hastily. "
Match 819: " he added, rather grimly.  the morning was fine, and they had still some minutes of leisure to spend. they had not met for two or three weeks, and mary had much to say to ralph; but she was not certain how far he wished for her company. however, after a turn or two, in which a few facts were communicated, he suggested sitting down, and she took the seat beside him. the sparrows came fluttering about them, and ralph produced from his pocket the half of a roll saved from his luncheon. he threw a few crumbs among them.  "
Match 820: " mary observed, by way of saying something.  "
Match 821: " said ralph. "
Match 822: "  mary felt that she could have forgone this display of animal good temper, but seeing that ralph, for some curious reason, took a pride in the sparrows, she bet him sixpence that he would not succeed.  "
Match 823: " he said; and his eye, which had been gloomy, showed a spark of light. his conversation was now addressed entirely to a bald cock-sparrow, who seemed bolder than the rest; and mary took the opportunity of looking at him. she was not satisfied; his face was worn, and his expression stern. a child came bowling its hoop through the concourse of birds, and ralph threw his last crumbs of bread into the bushes with a snort of impatience.  "
Match 824: " he said. "
Match 825: "  "
Match 826: "  "
Match 827: " he complained; "
Match 828: "  mary made no answer to this remark, but frowned.  she leant back on the seat and looked about her at the great houses breaking the soft gray-blue sky with their chimneys.  "
Match 829: " she said, "
Match 830: "  ralph sighed impatiently.  "
Match 831: " she added, as if his disagreement had been spoken.  "
Match 832: " he replied. "
Match 833: " he spoke without much vehemence of agreement or disagreement. he seemed chilled.  "
Match 834: " mary cried, turning and pinching his sleeve. "
Match 835: "  as he merely shook his head, and filled his pipe, she went on:  "
Match 836: "  "
Match 837: " he said.  "
Match 838: " mary remarked, "
Match 839: " she rose, but hesitated, looking down upon him rather gravely. "
Match 840: " she said. "
Match 841: "  he did not immediately answer her, but rose, too, and walked with her towards the gate. as usual, he did not speak to her without considering whether what he was about to say was the sort of thing that he could say to her.  "
Match 842: " he said at length. "
Match 843: "  "
Match 844: " said mary; and they passed the gate, and walked slowly round the fields again, discussing difficulties which, as a matter of fact, were more or less chronic in the denham family, and only now brought forward to appease mary's sympathy, which, however, soothed ralph more than he was aware of. she made him at least dwell upon problems which were real in the sense that they were capable of solution; and the true cause of his melancholy, which was not susceptible to such treatment, sank rather more deeply into the shades of his mind.  mary was attentive; she was helpful. ralph could not help feeling grateful to her, the more so, perhaps, because he had not told her the truth about his state; and when they reached the gate again he wished to make some affectionate objection to her leaving him. but his affection took the rather uncouth form of expostulating with her about her work.  "
Match 845: " he asked. "
Match 846: "  "
Match 847: " she said. "
Match 848: " she added suddenly, "
Match 849: "  "
Match 850: " ralph repeated.  "
Match 851: " she said, rather hastily, and then started off in the direction of russell square. she had invited him on the impulse of the moment, as a vision of the country came before her; and now she was annoyed with herself for having done so, and then she was annoyed at being annoyed.  "
Match 852: " she reasoned, "
Match 853: "  she shook her head. she really did not know what he had meant. she never felt quite certain; but now she was more than usually baffled. was he concealing something from her? his manner had been odd; his deep absorption had impressed her; there was something in him that she had not fathomed, and the mystery of his nature laid more of a spell upon her than she liked. moreover, she could not prevent herself from doing now what she had often blamed others of her sex for doing--from endowing her friend with a kind of heavenly fire, and passing her life before it for his sanction.  under this process, the committee rather dwindled in importance; the suffrage shrank; she vowed she would work harder at the italian language; she thought she would take up the study of birds. but this program for a perfect life threatened to become so absurd that she very soon caught herself out in the evil habit, and was rehearsing her speech to the committee by the time the chestnut-colored bricks of russell square came in sight. indeed, she never noticed them. she ran upstairs as usual, and was completely awakened to reality by the sight of mrs. seal, on the landing outside the office, inducing a very large dog to drink water out of a tumbler.  "
Match 854: " mrs. seal remarked, with due solemnity, "
Match 855: "  "
Match 856: " said mary, patting him on the head.  "
Match 857: " mrs. seal agreed. "
Match 858: " and scattering the rest of the water indiscriminately over the floor, she hurried mary into the committee-room.    chapter xiv  mr. clacton was in his glory. the machinery which he had perfected and controlled was now about to turn out its bi-monthly product, a committee meeting; and his pride in the perfect structure of these assemblies was great. he loved the jargon of committee-rooms; he loved the way in which the door kept opening as the clock struck the hour, in obedience to a few strokes of his pen on a piece of paper; and when it had opened sufficiently often, he loved to issue from his inner chamber with documents in his hands, visibly important, with a preoccupied expression on his face that might have suited a prime minister advancing to meet his cabinet. by his orders the table had been decorated beforehand with six sheets of blotting-paper, with six pens, six ink-pots, a tumbler and a jug of water, a bell, and, in deference to the taste of the lady members, a vase of hardy chrysanthemums. he had already surreptitiously straightened the sheets of blotting-paper in relation to the ink-pots, and now stood in front of the fire engaged in conversation with miss markham. but his eye was on the door, and when mary and mrs. seal entered, he gave a little laugh and observed to the assembly which was scattered about the room:  "
Match 859: "  so speaking, he took his seat at the head of the table, and arranging one bundle of papers upon his right and another upon his left, called upon miss datchet to read the minutes of the previous meeting. mary obeyed. a keen observer might have wondered why it was necessary for the secretary to knit her brows so closely over the tolerably matter-of-fact statement before her. could there be any doubt in her mind that it had been resolved to circularize the provinces with leaflet no. 3, or to issue a statistical diagram showing the proportion of married women to spinsters in new zealand; or that the net profits of mrs. hipsley's bazaar had reached a total of five pounds eight shillings and twopence half-penny?  could any doubt as to the perfect sense and propriety of these statements be disturbing her? no one could have guessed, from the look of her, that she was disturbed at all. a pleasanter and saner woman than mary datchet was never seen within a committee-room. she seemed a compound of the autumn leaves and the winter sunshine; less poetically speaking, she showed both gentleness and strength, an indefinable promise of soft maternity blending with her evident fitness for honest labor. nevertheless, she had great difficulty in reducing her mind to obedience; and her reading lacked conviction, as if, as was indeed the case, she had lost the power of visualizing what she read. and directly the list was completed, her mind floated to lincoln's inn fields and the fluttering wings of innumerable sparrows. was ralph still enticing the bald-headed cock-sparrow to sit upon his hand? had he succeeded? would he ever succeed? she had meant to ask him why it is that the sparrows in lincoln's inn fields are tamer than the sparrows in hyde park--perhaps it is that the passers-by are rarer, and they come to recognize their benefactors. for the first half-hour of the committee meeting, mary had thus to do battle with the skeptical presence of ralph denham, who threatened to have it all his own way. mary tried half a dozen methods of ousting him. she raised her voice, she articulated distinctly, she looked firmly at mr. clacton's bald head, she began to write a note. to her annoyance, her pencil drew a little round figure on the blotting-paper, which, she could not deny, was really a bald-headed cock-sparrow. she looked again at mr. clacton; yes, he was bald, and so are cock-sparrows. never was a secretary tormented by so many unsuitable suggestions, and they all came, alas! with something ludicrously grotesque about them, which might, at any moment, provoke her to such flippancy as would shock her colleagues for ever. the thought of what she might say made her bite her lips, as if her lips would protect her.  but all these suggestions were but flotsam and jetsam cast to the surface by a more profound disturbance, which, as she could not consider it at present, manifested its existence by these grotesque nods and beckonings. consider it, she must, when the committee was over. meanwhile, she was behaving scandalously; she was looking out of the window, and thinking of the color of the sky, and of the decorations on the imperial hotel, when she ought to have been shepherding her colleagues, and pinning them down to the matter in hand. she could not bring herself to attach more weight to one project than to another. ralph had said--she could not stop to consider what he had said, but he had somehow divested the proceedings of all reality. and then, without conscious effort, by some trick of the brain, she found herself becoming interested in some scheme for organizing a newspaper campaign. certain articles were to be written; certain editors approached. what line was it advisable to take? she found herself strongly disapproving of what mr. clacton was saying. she committed herself to the opinion that now was the time to strike hard. directly she had said this, she felt that she had turned upon ralph's ghost; and she became more and more in earnest, and anxious to bring the others round to her point of view. once more, she knew exactly and indisputably what is right and what is wrong. as if emerging from a mist, the old foes of the public good loomed ahead of her--capitalists, newspaper proprietors, anti-suffragists, and, in some ways most pernicious of all, the masses who take no interest one way or another--among whom, for the time being, she certainly discerned the features of ralph denham. indeed, when miss markham asked her to suggest the names of a few friends of hers, she expressed herself with unusual bitterness:  "
Match 860: " she felt that she was really saying that to ralph himself.  "
Match 861: " said miss markham, with a little laugh; and with renewed vigor their legions charged the foe.  mary's spirits had been low when she entered the committee-room; but now they were considerably improved. she knew the ways of this world; it was a shapely, orderly place; she felt convinced of its right and its wrong; and the feeling that she was fit to deal a heavy blow against her enemies warmed her heart and kindled her eye. in one of those flights of fancy, not characteristic of her but tiresomely frequent this afternoon, she envisaged herself battered with rotten eggs upon a platform, from which ralph vainly begged her to descend. but--  "
Match 862: " she said, and so on. much to her credit, however teased by foolish fancies, she kept the surface of her brain moderate and vigilant, and subdued mrs. seal very tactfully more than once when she demanded, "
Match 863: " as became her father's daughter.  the other members of the committee, who were all rather elderly people, were a good deal impressed by mary, and inclined to side with her and against each other, partly, perhaps, because of her youth. the feeling that she controlled them all filled mary with a sense of power; and she felt that no work can equal in importance, or be so exciting as, the work of making other people do what you want them to do. indeed, when she had won her point she felt a slight degree of contempt for the people who had yielded to her.  the committee now rose, gathered together their papers, shook them straight, placed them in their attache-cases, snapped the locks firmly together, and hurried away, having, for the most part, to catch trains, in order to keep other appointments with other committees, for they were all busy people. mary, mrs. seal, and mr. clacton were left alone; the room was hot and untidy, the pieces of pink blotting-paper were lying at different angles upon the table, and the tumbler was half full of water, which some one had poured out and forgotten to drink.  mrs. seal began preparing the tea, while mr. clacton retired to his room to file the fresh accumulation of documents. mary was too much excited even to help mrs. seal with the cups and saucers. she flung up the window and stood by it, looking out. the street lamps were already lit; and through the mist in the square one could see little figures hurrying across the road and along the pavement, on the farther side. in her absurd mood of lustful arrogance, mary looked at the little figures and thought, "
Match 864: " then mrs. seal came and stood by her.  "
Match 865: " mary asked, in rather a condescending tone of voice, feeling a sort of pity for the enthusiastic ineffective little woman. but mrs. seal paid no attention to the suggestion.  "
Match 866: " mary asked, with a little laugh.  mrs. seal drew a deep breath, restrained herself, and then burst out, looking out, too, upon russell square and southampton row, and at the passers-by, "
Match 867: "  mary knew herself to be very much wiser than mrs. seal, and when mrs. seal said anything, even if it was what mary herself was feeling, she automatically thought of all that there was to be said against it. on this occasion her arrogant feeling that she could direct everybody dwindled away.  "
Match 868: " she said, turning back from the window and pulling down the blind. "
Match 869: " she let fall, casually, as she sat down at the table. surely mrs. seal must realize that mary had been extraordinarily efficient?  "
Match 870: " said sally, shaking her head impatiently.  at this mary burst out laughing, and all her arrogance was dissipated.  "
Match 871: " said sally, with another shake of her head, "
Match 872: "  "
Match 873: " said mary, kindly.  "
Match 874: " said mrs. seal, with a toss of her locks. "
Match 875: "  she was carrying plates and cups from the cupboard as she spoke, so that her sentences were more than usually broken apart. mary could not help looking at the odd little priestess of humanity with something like admiration. while she had been thinking about herself, mrs. seal had thought of nothing but her vision.  "
Match 876: " she said, rising and trying to take a plate of biscuits from mrs. seal's hands.  "
Match 877: " she exclaimed, clinging more tightly than before to her plate of biscuits. "
Match 878: "  they had their tea, and went over many of the points that had been raised in the committee rather more intimately than had been possible then; and they all felt an agreeable sense of being in some way behind the scenes; of having their hands upon strings which, when pulled, would completely change the pageant exhibited daily to those who read the newspapers. although their views were very different, this sense united them and made them almost cordial in their manners to each other.  mary, however, left the tea-party rather early, desiring both to be alone, and then to hear some music at the queen's hall. she fully intended to use her loneliness to think out her position with regard to ralph; but although she walked back to the strand with this end in view, she found her mind uncomfortably full of different trains of thought. she started one and then another. they seemed even to take their color from the street she happened to be in. thus the vision of humanity appeared to be in some way connected with bloomsbury, and faded distinctly by the time she crossed the main road; then a belated organ-grinder in holborn set her thoughts dancing incongruously; and by the time she was crossing the great misty square of lincoln's inn fields, she was cold and depressed again, and horribly clear-sighted. the dark removed the stimulus of human companionship, and a tear actually slid down her cheek, accompanying a sudden conviction within her that she loved ralph, and that he didn't love her. all dark and empty now was the path where they had walked that morning, and the sparrows silent in the bare trees. but the lights in her own building soon cheered her; all these different states of mind were submerged in the deep flood of desires, thoughts, perceptions, antagonisms, which washed perpetually at the base of her being, to rise into prominence in turn when the conditions of the upper world were favorable. she put off the hour of clear thought until christmas, saying to herself, as she lit her fire, that it is impossible to think anything out in london; and, no doubt, ralph wouldn't come at christmas, and she would take long walks into the heart of the country, and decide this question and all the others that puzzled her. meanwhile, she thought, drawing her feet up on to the fender, life was full of complexity; life was a thing one must love to the last fiber of it.  she had sat there for five minutes or so, and her thoughts had had time to grow dim, when there came a ring at her bell. her eye brightened; she felt immediately convinced that ralph had come to visit her. accordingly, she waited a moment before opening the door; she wanted to feel her hands secure upon the reins of all the troublesome emotions which the sight of ralph would certainly arouse. she composed herself unnecessarily, however, for she had to admit, not ralph, but katharine and william rodney. her first impression was that they were both extremely well dressed. she felt herself shabby and slovenly beside them, and did not know how she should entertain them, nor could she guess why they had come. she had heard nothing of their engagement. but after the first disappointment, she was pleased, for she felt instantly that katharine was a personality, and, moreover, she need not now exercise her self-control.  "
Match 879: " katharine explained, standing and looking very tall and distinguished and rather absent-minded.  "
Match 880: " said william. "
Match 881: " he exclaimed, looking about him, "
Match 882: "  sitting down, he drew off his light yellow gloves, and began slapping his knees with them. his vitality was pleasant, mary thought, although he made her laugh. the very look of him was inclined to make her laugh. his rather prominent eyes passed from one young woman to the other, and his lips perpetually formed words which remained unspoken.  "
Match 883: " said katharine, apparently paying no attention to william, and accepting a cigarette which mary offered her. she leant back in her chair, and the smoke which hung about her face seemed to withdraw her still further from the others.  "
Match 884: " william continued, "
Match 885: "  had they been quarreling, mary wondered, and had they, for that reason, sought refuge in her room, or were they engaged, or had katharine just refused him? she was completely baffled.  katharine now reappeared from her veil of smoke, knocked the ash from her cigarette into the fireplace, and looked, with an odd expression of solicitude, at the irritable man.  "
Match 886: " she said tentatively, "
Match 887: " she spoke with a kind of guarded gentleness.  mary, accordingly, retired to make preparations in the pantry.  "
Match 888: " she asked of her own reflection in the little looking-glass which hung there. she was not left to doubt much longer, for, on coming back into the sitting-room with the tea-things, katharine informed her, apparently having been instructed so to do by william, of their engagement.  "
Match 889: " she said, "
Match 890: "  mary found herself shaking william's hand, and addressing her congratulations to him, as if katharine were inaccessible; she had, indeed, taken hold of the tea-kettle.  "
Match 891: " katharine said, "
Match 892: "  mary was half inclined to suspect that this was said in order to conceal nervousness, but if so, the concealment was unusually perfect. talk of marriage was dismissed. katharine might have been seated in her own drawing-room, controlling a situation which presented no sort of difficulty to her trained mind. rather to her surprise, mary found herself making conversation with william about old italian pictures, while katharine poured out tea, cut cake, kept william's plate supplied, without joining more than was necessary in the conversation. she seemed to have taken possession of mary's room, and to handle the cups as if they belonged to her. but it was done so naturally that it bred no resentment in mary; on the contrary, she found herself putting her hand on katharine's knee, affectionately, for an instant. was there something maternal in this assumption of control? and thinking of katharine as one who would soon be married, these maternal airs filled mary's mind with a new tenderness, and even with awe. katharine seemed very much older and more experienced than she was.  meanwhile rodney talked. if his appearance was superficially against him, it had the advantage of making his solid merits something of a surprise. he had kept notebooks; he knew a great deal about pictures. he could compare different examples in different galleries, and his authoritative answers to intelligent questions gained not a little, mary felt, from the smart taps which he dealt, as he delivered them, upon the lumps of coal. she was impressed.  "
Match 893: " said katharine gently.  he paused, gulped it down, obediently, and continued.  and then it struck mary that katharine, in the shade of her broad-brimmed hat, and in the midst of the smoke, and in the obscurity of her character, was, perhaps, smiling to herself, not altogether in the maternal spirit. what she said was very simple, but her words, even "
Match 894: " were set down as gently and cautiously and exactly as the feet of a persian cat stepping among china ornaments. for the second time that day mary felt herself baffled by something inscrutable in the character of a person to whom she felt herself much attracted. she thought that if she were engaged to katharine, she, too, would find herself very soon using those fretful questions with which william evidently teased his bride. and yet katharine's voice was humble.  "
Match 895: " she asked.  "
Match 896: " william answered, delighted, mary guessed, at this little compliment. "
Match 897: " he explained, turning to mary, "
Match 898: " and he gave his queer little chuckle. somehow this compliment appeared very old-fashioned and almost in bad taste. mary actually felt herself blush, as if he had said "
Match 899: " or "
Match 900: " constrained, perhaps, by nervousness, rodney continued in the same vein.  "
Match 901: "  "
Match 902: " said katharine, apparently waking from a brown study. "
Match 903: "  "
Match 904: " said rodney, rising. "
Match 905: " he added, for her information, as she looked doubtful. "
Match 906: "  "
Match 907: " said katharine. "
Match 908: " she added, as if to qualify her abruptness, "
Match 909: "  "
Match 910: " he said, turning to mary, as he had frequently done already. "
Match 911: "--here he took out a large gold watch, and tapped the glass--"
Match 912: "  "
Match 913: " katharine apologized. "
Match 914: "  the rest of her excuse was cut short, so far as mary was concerned, by the closing of the door. she fancied she could hear william finding fresh fault on the stairs. a moment later, the door-bell rang again, and katharine reappeared, having left her purse on a chair. she soon found it, and said, pausing for a moment at the door, and speaking differently as they were alone:  "
Match 915: " she shook her purse in her hand until the coins jingled, as if she alluded merely to this example of her forgetfulness. but the remark puzzled mary; it seemed to refer to something else; and her manner had changed so strangely, now that william was out of hearing, that she could not help looking at her for an explanation. she looked almost stern, so that mary, trying to smile at her, only succeeded in producing a silent stare of interrogation.  as the door shut for the second time, she sank on to the floor in front of the fire, trying, now that their bodies were not there to distract her, to piece together her impressions of them as a whole. and, though priding herself, with all other men and women, upon an infallible eye for character, she could not feel at all certain that she knew what motives inspired katharine hilbery in life. there was something that carried her on smoothly, out of reach--something, yes, but what?--something that reminded mary of ralph. oddly enough, he gave her the same feeling, too, and with him, too, she felt baffled. oddly enough, for no two people, she hastily concluded, were more unlike. and yet both had this hidden impulse, this incalculable force--this thing they cared for and didn't talk about--oh, what was it?    chapter xv  the village of disham lies somewhere on the rolling piece of cultivated ground in the neighborhood of lincoln, not so far inland but that a sound, bringing rumors of the sea, can be heard on summer nights or when the winter storms fling the waves upon the long beach. so large is the church, and in particular the church tower, in comparison with the little street of cottages which compose the village, that the traveler is apt to cast his mind back to the middle ages, as the only time when so much piety could have been kept alive. so great a trust in the church can surely not belong to our day, and he goes on to conjecture that every one of the villagers has reached the extreme limit of human life. such are the reflections of the superficial stranger, and his sight of the population, as it is represented by two or three men hoeing in a turnip-field, a small child carrying a jug, and a young woman shaking a piece of carpet outside her cottage door, will not lead him to see anything very much out of keeping with the middle ages in the village of disham as it is to-day. these people, though they seem young enough, look so angular and so crude that they remind him of the little pictures painted by monks in the capital letters of their manuscripts. he only half understands what they say, and speaks very loud and clearly, as though, indeed, his voice had to carry through a hundred years or more before it reached them. he would have a far better chance of understanding some dweller in paris or rome, berlin or madrid, than these countrymen of his who have lived for the last two thousand years not two hundred miles from the city of london.  the rectory stands about half a mile beyond the village. it is a large house, and has been growing steadily for some centuries round the great kitchen, with its narrow red tiles, as the rector would point out to his guests on the first night of their arrival, taking his brass candlestick, and bidding them mind the steps up and the steps down, and notice the immense thickness of the walls, the old beams across the ceiling, the staircases as steep as ladders, and the attics, with their deep, tent-like roofs, in which swallows bred, and once a white owl. but nothing very interesting or very beautiful had resulted from the different additions made by the different rectors.  the house, however, was surrounded by a garden, in which the rector took considerable pride. the lawn, which fronted the drawing-room windows, was a rich and uniform green, unspotted by a single daisy, and on the other side of it two straight paths led past beds of tall, standing flowers to a charming grassy walk, where the rev. wyndham datchet would pace up and down at the same hour every morning, with a sundial to measure the time for him. as often as not, he carried a book in his hand, into which he would glance, then shut it up, and repeat the rest of the ode from memory. he had most of horace by heart, and had got into the habit of connecting this particular walk with certain odes which he repeated duly, at the same time noting the condition of his flowers, and stooping now and again to pick any that were withered or overblown. on wet days, such was the power of habit over him, he rose from his chair at the same hour, and paced his study for the same length of time, pausing now and then to straighten some book in the bookcase, or alter the position of the two brass crucifixes standing upon cairns of serpentine stone upon the mantelpiece. his children had a great respect for him, credited him with far more learning than he actually possessed, and saw that his habits were not interfered with, if possible. like most people who do things methodically, the rector himself had more strength of purpose and power of self-sacrifice than of intellect or of originality. on cold and windy nights he rode off to visit sick people, who might need him, without a murmur; and by virtue of doing dull duties punctually, he was much employed upon committees and local boards and councils; and at this period of his life (he was sixty-eight) he was beginning to be commiserated by tender old ladies for the extreme leanness of his person, which, they said, was worn out upon the roads when it should have been resting before a comfortable fire. his elder daughter, elizabeth, lived with him and managed the house, and already much resembled him in dry sincerity and methodical habit of mind; of the two sons one, richard, was an estate agent, the other, christopher, was reading for the bar. at christmas, naturally, they met together; and for a month past the arrangement of the christmas week had been much in the mind of mistress and maid, who prided themselves every year more confidently upon the excellence of their equipment. the late mrs. datchet had left an excellent cupboard of linen, to which elizabeth had succeeded at the age of nineteen, when her mother died, and the charge of the family rested upon the shoulders of the eldest daughter. she kept a fine flock of yellow chickens, sketched a little, certain rose-trees in the garden were committed specially to her care; and what with the care of the house, the care of the chickens, and the care of the poor, she scarcely knew what it was to have an idle minute. an extreme rectitude of mind, rather than any gift, gave her weight in the family. when mary wrote to say that she had asked ralph denham to stay with them, she added, out of deference to elizabeth's character, that he was very nice, though rather queer, and had been overworking himself in london. no doubt elizabeth would conclude that ralph was in love with her, but there could be no doubt either that not a word of this would be spoken by either of them, unless, indeed, some catastrophe made mention of it unavoidable.  mary went down to disham without knowing whether ralph intended to come; but two or three days before christmas she received a telegram from ralph, asking her to take a room for him in the village. this was followed by a letter explaining that he hoped he might have his meals with them; but quiet, essential for his work, made it necessary to sleep out.  mary was walking in the garden with elizabeth, and inspecting the roses, when the letter arrived.  "
Match 916: " said elizabeth decidedly, when the plan was explained to her. "
Match 917: "  "
Match 918: " mary thought to herself, although outwardly she assented, and felt grateful to elizabeth for supporting her in what was, of course, her desire. they were cutting roses at the time, and laying them, head by head, in a shallow basket.  "
Match 919: " mary thought, with a little shiver of irritation, which led her to place her rose the wrong way in the basket. meanwhile, they had come to the end of the path, and while elizabeth straightened some flowers, and made them stand upright within their fence of string, mary looked at her father, who was pacing up and down, with his hand behind his back and his head bowed in meditation. obeying an impulse which sprang from some desire to interrupt this methodical marching, mary stepped on to the grass walk and put her hand on his arm.  "
Match 920: " she said, presenting a rose.  "
Match 921: " said mr. datchet, taking the flower, and holding it at an angle which suited his bad eyesight, without pausing in his walk.  "
Match 922: "  he had a habit, mary remarked, and she had never noticed it so clearly before, of letting his sentences tail away in a continuous murmur, whereupon he passed into a state of abstraction, presumed by his children to indicate some train of thought too profound for utterance.  "
Match 923: " said mary, interrupting, for the first time in her life, perhaps, when the murmur ceased. he made no reply. she knew very well that he wished to be left alone, but she stuck to his side much as she might have stuck to some sleep-walker, whom she thought it right gradually to awaken. she could think of nothing to rouse him with except:  "
Match 924: "  "
Match 925: " said mr. datchet, running his words together in the same abstracted manner, and sinking his head yet lower upon his breast. and suddenly, as they turned their steps to retrace their way, he jerked out:  "
Match 926: "  she said "
Match 927: " as he seemed to wish for a reply, and then he looked at his watch, and made off down the path towards the house, holding the rose at the same angle in front of him. elizabeth had gone round to the side of the house, where the chickens lived, so that mary found herself alone, holding ralph's letter in her hand. she was uneasy. she had put off the season for thinking things out very successfully, and now that ralph was actually coming, the next day, she could only wonder how her family would impress him. she thought it likely that her father would discuss the train service with him; elizabeth would be bright and sensible, and always leaving the room to give messages to the servants. her brothers had already said that they would give him a day's shooting. she was content to leave the problem of ralph's relations to the young men obscure, trusting that they would find some common ground of masculine agreement. but what would he think of her? would he see that she was different from the rest of the family? she devised a plan for taking him to her sitting-room, and artfully leading the talk towards the english poets, who now occupied prominent places in her little bookcase. moreover, she might give him to understand, privately, that she, too, thought her family a queer one--queer, yes, but not dull. that was the rock past which she was bent on steering him. and she thought how she would draw his attention to edward's passion for jorrocks, and the enthusiasm which led christopher to collect moths and butterflies though he was now twenty-two. perhaps elizabeth's sketching, if the fruits were invisible, might lend color to the general effect which she wished to produce of a family, eccentric and limited, perhaps, but not dull. edward, she perceived, was rolling the lawn, for the sake of exercise; and the sight of him, with pink cheeks, bright little brown eyes, and a general resemblance to a clumsy young cart-horse in its winter coat of dusty brown hair, made mary violently ashamed of her ambitious scheming. she loved him precisely as he was; she loved them all; and as she walked by his side, up and down, and down and up, her strong moral sense administered a sound drubbing to the vain and romantic element aroused in her by the mere thought of ralph. she felt quite certain that, for good or for bad, she was very like the rest of her family.  sitting in the corner of a third-class railway carriage, on the afternoon of the following day, ralph made several inquiries of a commercial traveler in the opposite corner. they centered round a village called lampsher, not three miles, he understood, from lincoln; was there a big house in lampsher, he asked, inhabited by a gentleman of the name of otway?  the traveler knew nothing, but rolled the name of otway on his tongue, reflectively, and the sound of it gratified ralph amazingly. it gave him an excuse to take a letter from his pocket in order to verify the address.  "
Match 928: " he read out.  "
Match 929: " said the man; and ralph had to confess that he was not bound there this very evening.  "
Match 930: " he said, and in the heart of him could not help marveling at the pleasure which he derived from making a bagman in a train believe what he himself did not believe. for the letter, though signed by katharine's father, contained no invitation or warrant for thinking that katharine herself was there; the only fact it disclosed was that for a fortnight this address would be mr. hilbery's address. but when he looked out of the window, it was of her he thought; she, too, had seen these gray fields, and, perhaps, she was there where the trees ran up a slope, and one yellow light shone now, and then went out again, at the foot of the hill. the light shone in the windows of an old gray house, he thought. he lay back in his corner and forgot the commercial traveler altogether. the process of visualizing katharine stopped short at the old gray manor-house; instinct warned him that if he went much further with this process reality would soon force itself in; he could not altogether neglect the figure of william rodney. since the day when he had heard from katharine's lips of her engagement, he had refrained from investing his dream of her with the details of real life. but the light of the late afternoon glowed green behind the straight trees, and became a symbol of her. the light seemed to expand his heart. she brooded over the gray fields, and was with him now in the railway carriage, thoughtful, silent, and infinitely tender; but the vision pressed too close, and must be dismissed, for the train was slackening. its abrupt jerks shook him wide awake, and he saw mary datchet, a sturdy russet figure, with a dash of scarlet about it, as the carriage slid down the platform. a tall youth who accompanied her shook him by the hand, took his bag, and led the way without uttering one articulate word.  never are voices so beautiful as on a winter's evening, when dusk almost hides the body, and they seem to issue from nothingness with a note of intimacy seldom heard by day. such an edge was there in mary's voice when she greeted him. about her seemed to hang the mist of the winter hedges, and the clear red of the bramble leaves. he felt himself at once stepping on to the firm ground of an entirely different world, but he did not allow himself to yield to the pleasure of it directly. they gave him his choice of driving with edward or of walking home across the fields with mary--not a shorter way, they explained, but mary thought it a nicer way. he decided to walk with her, being conscious, indeed, that he got comfort from her presence. what could be the cause of her cheerfulness, he wondered, half ironically, and half enviously, as the pony-cart started briskly away, and the dusk swam between their eyes and the tall form of edward, standing up to drive, with the reins in one hand and the whip in the other. people from the village, who had been to the market town, were climbing into their gigs, or setting off home down the road together in little parties. many salutations were addressed to mary, who shouted back, with the addition of the speaker's name. but soon she led the way over a stile, and along a path worn slightly darker than the dim green surrounding it. in front of them the sky now showed itself of a reddish-yellow, like a slice of some semilucent stone behind which a lamp burnt, while a fringe of black trees with distinct branches stood against the light, which was obscured in one direction by a hump of earth, in all other directions the land lying flat to the very verge of the sky. one of the swift and noiseless birds of the winter's night seemed to follow them across the field, circling a few feet in front of them, disappearing and returning again and again.  mary had gone this walk many hundred times in the course of her life, generally alone, and at different stages the ghosts of past moods would flood her mind with a whole scene or train of thought merely at the sight of three trees from a particular angle, or at the sound of the pheasant clucking in the ditch. but to-night the circumstances were strong enough to oust all other scenes; and she looked at the field and the trees with an involuntary intensity as if they had no such associations for her.  "
Match 931: " she said, "
Match 932: "  "
Match 933: " said ralph. "
Match 934: "  "
Match 935: " she said boldly. "
Match 936: "  "
Match 937: " he said sturdily. they walked on in silence; mary took care not to break it for a time. she wished ralph to feel, as she thought he would, all the fresh delights of the earth and air. she was right. in a moment he expressed his pleasure, much to her comfort.  "
Match 938: " he said, pushing his hat back on his head, and looking about him. "
Match 939: "  he snuffed the air, and felt more keenly than he had done for many weeks the pleasure of owning a body.  "
Match 940: " said mary. in the gap of the hedge ralph tore up a poacher's wire, set across a hole to trap a rabbit.  "
Match 941: " said mary, watching him tugging at the wire. "
Match 942: " she repeated, coming out on the other side of the hedge, and running her fingers through her hair to rid herself of a bramble which had attached itself to her. "
Match 943: "  "
Match 944: " said ralph. "
Match 945: " he added.  "
Match 946: " said mary, with a soberness which impressed ralph very much.  "
Match 947: " he urged.  "
Match 948: " she replied.  the idea of a cottage where one grew one's own vegetables and lived on fifteen shillings a week, filled ralph with an extraordinary sense of rest and satisfaction.  "
Match 949: "  "
Match 950: "  "
Match 951: " he asked, attempting sarcasm.  "
Match 952: " she replied, in an off-hand manner which was slightly mysterious.  ralph fell silent. it annoyed him that she should have plans of which he knew nothing; but he felt that he had no right to press her further. his mind settled upon the idea of life in a country cottage. conceivably, for he could not examine into it now, here lay a tremendous possibility; a solution of many problems. he struck his stick upon the earth, and stared through the dusk at the shape of the country.  "
Match 953: " he asked.  "
Match 954: " said mary. "
Match 955: " she then told him exactly where the north lay, and where the south.  "
Match 956: " she said. "
Match 957: "  as if to prove this boast, she walked a little quicker, so that ralph found it difficult to keep pace with her. at the same time, he felt drawn to her as he had never been before; partly, no doubt, because she was more independent of him than in london, and seemed to be attached firmly to a world where he had no place at all. now the dusk had fallen to such an extent that he had to follow her implicitly, and even lean his hand on her shoulder when they jumped a bank into a very narrow lane. and he felt curiously shy of her when she began to shout through her hands at a spot of light which swung upon the mist in a neighboring field. he shouted, too, and the light stood still.  "
Match 958: " she said.  she introduced him to ralph, who could see only a tall figure in gaiters, rising from a fluttering circle of soft feathery bodies, upon whom the light fell in wavering discs, calling out now a bright spot of yellow, now one of greenish-black and scarlet. mary dipped her hand in the bucket he carried, and was at once the center of a circle also; and as she cast her grain she talked alternately to the birds and to her brother, in the same clucking, half-inarticulate voice, as it sounded to ralph, standing on the outskirts of the fluttering feathers in his black overcoat.  he had removed his overcoat by the time they sat round the dinner-table, but nevertheless he looked very strange among the others. a country life and breeding had preserved in them all a look which mary hesitated to call either innocent or youthful, as she compared them, now sitting round in an oval, softly illuminated by candlelight; and yet it was something of the kind, yes, even in the case of the rector himself. though superficially marked with lines, his face was a clear pink, and his blue eyes had the long-sighted, peaceful expression of eyes seeking the turn of the road, or a distant light through rain, or the darkness of winter. she looked at ralph. he had never appeared to her more concentrated and full of purpose; as if behind his forehead were massed so much experience that he could choose for himself which part of it he would display and which part he would keep to himself. compared with that dark and stern countenance, her brothers' faces, bending low over their soup-plates, were mere circles of pink, unmolded flesh.  "
Match 959: " said the reverend wyndham datchet, tucking his napkin into his collar, so that almost the whole of his body was concealed by a large white diamond. "
Match 960: "  the old gentleman had been roused agreeably by the presence of this attentive and well-informed young man, as was evident by the care with which he finished the last words in his sentences, and his slight exaggeration in the number of trucks on the trains. indeed, the chief burden of the talk fell upon him, and he sustained it to-night in a manner which caused his sons to look at him admiringly now and then; for they felt shy of denham, and were glad not to have to talk themselves. the store of information about the present and past of this particular corner of lincolnshire which old mr. datchet produced really surprised his children, for though they knew of its existence, they had forgotten its extent, as they might have forgotten the amount of family plate stored in the plate-chest, until some rare celebration brought it forth.  after dinner, parish business took the rector to his study, and mary proposed that they should sit in the kitchen.  "
Match 961: " elizabeth hastened to explain to her guest, "
Match 962: "  "
Match 963: " said edward.  "
Match 964: " said elizabeth, leading the way, with a tall brass candlestick in her hand, down a passage. "
Match 965: " she, too, felt an impulse to exaggerate the age of the bricks, as her father had exaggerated the number of trucks. a big lamp hung down from the center of the ceiling and, together with a fine log fire, illuminated a large and lofty room, with rafters running from wall to wall, a floor of red tiles, and a substantial fireplace built up of those narrow red bricks which were said to be five hundred years old. a few rugs and a sprinkling of arm-chairs had made this ancient kitchen into a sitting-room. elizabeth, after pointing out the gun-racks, and the hooks for smoking hams, and other evidence of incontestable age, and explaining that mary had had the idea of turning the room into a sitting-room--otherwise it was used for hanging out the wash and for the men to change in after shooting--considered that she had done her duty as hostess, and sat down in an upright chair directly beneath the lamp, beside a very long and narrow oak table. she placed a pair of horn spectacles upon her nose, and drew towards her a basketful of threads and wools. in a few minutes a smile came to her face, and remained there for the rest of the evening.  "
Match 966: " said christopher, who had, on the whole, formed a favorable impression of his sister's friend.  "
Match 967: " said ralph.  "
Match 968: " asked edward, whose suspicions were not yet laid to rest.  "
Match 969: " said ralph, turning and looking him in the face, because he was not sure how this confession would be received.  "
Match 970: " said christopher. "
Match 971: "  "
Match 972: " ralph replied, with a smile.  "
Match 973: " said edward, "
Match 974: "  "
Match 975: " ralph replied. they were all gratified by this praise of their native county; and mary now had the pleasure of hearing these short questions and answers lose their undertone of suspicious inspection, so far as her brothers were concerned, and develop into a genuine conversation about the habits of birds which afterwards turned to a discussion as to the habits of solicitors, in which it was scarcely necessary for her to take part. she was pleased to see that her brothers liked ralph, to the extent, that is, of wishing to secure his good opinion. whether or not he liked them it was impossible to tell from his kind but experienced manner. now and then she fed the fire with a fresh log, and as the room filled with the fine, dry heat of burning wood, they all, with the exception of elizabeth, who was outside the range of the fire, felt less and less anxious about the effect they were making, and more and more inclined for sleep. at this moment a vehement scratching was heard on the door.  "
Match 976: " murmured christopher.  "
Match 977: " edward grunted.  "
Match 978: " christopher grumbled. he let in the dog, and stood for a moment by the door, which opened into the garden, to revive himself with a draught of the black, starlit air.  "
Match 979: " mary cried, half turning in her chair.  "
Match 980: " said christopher with complacency, and he sat himself on the floor at her feet, and leant his back against her knees, and stretched out his long stockinged legs to the fire--all signs that he felt no longer any restraint at the presence of the stranger. he was the youngest of the family, and mary's favorite, partly because his character resembled hers, as edward's character resembled elizabeth's. she made her knees a comfortable rest for his head, and ran her fingers through his hair.  "
Match 981: " ralph thought to himself suddenly, and he looked at christopher, almost affectionately, for calling forth his sister's caresses. instantly he thought of katharine, the thought of her being surrounded by the spaces of night and the open air; and mary, watching him, saw the lines upon his forehead suddenly deepen. he stretched out an arm and placed a log upon the fire, constraining himself to fit it carefully into the frail red scaffolding, and also to limit his thoughts to this one room.  mary had ceased to stroke her brother's head; he moved it impatiently between her knees, and, much as though he were a child, she began once more to part the thick, reddish-colored locks this way and that. but a far stronger passion had taken possession of her soul than any her brother could inspire in her, and, seeing ralph's change of expression, her hand almost automatically continued its movements, while her mind plunged desperately for some hold upon slippery banks.    chapter xvi  into that same black night, almost, indeed, into the very same layer of starlit air, katharine hilbery was now gazing, although not with a view to the prospects of a fine day for duck shooting on the morrow. she was walking up and down a gravel path in the garden of stogdon house, her sight of the heavens being partially intercepted by the light leafless hoops of a pergola. thus a spray of clematis would completely obscure cassiopeia, or blot out with its black pattern myriads of miles of the milky way. at the end of the pergola, however, there was a stone seat, from which the sky could be seen completely swept clear of any earthly interruption, save to the right, indeed, where a line of elm-trees was beautifully sprinkled with stars, and a low stable building had a full drop of quivering silver just issuing from the mouth of the chimney. it was a moonless night, but the light of the stars was sufficient to show the outline of the young woman's form, and the shape of her face gazing gravely, indeed almost sternly, into the sky. she had come out into the winter's night, which was mild enough, not so much to look with scientific eyes upon the stars, as to shake herself free from certain purely terrestrial discontents. much as a literary person in like circumstances would begin, absent-mindedly, pulling out volume after volume, so she stepped into the garden in order to have the stars at hand, even though she did not look at them. not to be happy, when she was supposed to be happier than she would ever be again--that, as far as she could see, was the origin of a discontent which had begun almost as soon as she arrived, two days before, and seemed now so intolerable that she had left the family party, and come out here to consider it by herself. it was not she who thought herself unhappy, but her cousins, who thought it for her. the house was full of cousins, much of her age, or even younger, and among them they had some terribly bright eyes. they seemed always on the search for something between her and rodney, which they expected to find, and yet did not find; and when they searched, katharine became aware of wanting what she had not been conscious of wanting in london, alone with william and her parents. or, if she did not want it, she missed it. and this state of mind depressed her, because she had been accustomed always to give complete satisfaction, and her self-love was now a little ruffled. she would have liked to break through the reserve habitual to her in order to justify her engagement to some one whose opinion she valued. no one had spoken a word of criticism, but they left her alone with william; not that that would have mattered, if they had not left her alone so politely; and, perhaps, that would not have mattered if they had not seemed so queerly silent, almost respectful, in her presence, which gave way to criticism, she felt, out of it.  looking now and then at the sky, she went through the list of her cousins' names: eleanor, humphrey, marmaduke, silvia, henry, cassandra, gilbert, and mostyn--henry, the cousin who taught the young ladies of bungay to play upon the violin, was the only one in whom she could confide, and as she walked up and down beneath the hoops of the pergola, she did begin a little speech to him, which ran something like this:  "
Match 982: " here, presumably, she imagined that her cousin, who had listened with his usual intelligent sympathy, raised his eyebrows a little, and interposed:  "
Match 983: "  even in this purely imaginary dialogue, katharine found it difficult to confide her ambition to an imaginary companion.  "
Match 984: " she began, and hesitated quite a long time before she forced herself to add, with a change of voice, "
Match 985: "  henry was clearly amazed, but too kind to express all his doubts; he only said something about the difficulties of mathematics, and remarked that very little was known about the stars.  katharine thereupon went on with the statement of her case.  "
Match 986: "  having reached this point, instinct told her that she had passed beyond the region in which henry's advice could be of any good; and, having rid her mind of its superficial annoyance, she sat herself upon the stone seat, raised her eyes unconsciously and thought about the deeper questions which she had to decide, she knew, for herself. would she, indeed, give william all he wanted? in order to decide the question, she ran her mind rapidly over her little collection of significant sayings, looks, compliments, gestures, which had marked their intercourse during the last day or two. he had been annoyed because a box, containing some clothes specially chosen by him for her to wear, had been taken to the wrong station, owing to her neglect in the matter of labels. the box had arrived in the nick of time, and he had remarked, as she came downstairs on the first night, that he had never seen her look more beautiful. she outshone all her cousins. he had discovered that she never made an ugly movement; he also said that the shape of her head made it possible for her, unlike most women, to wear her hair low. he had twice reproved her for being silent at dinner; and once for never attending to what he said. he had been surprised at the excellence of her french accent, but he thought it was selfish of her not to go with her mother to call upon the middletons, because they were old family friends and very nice people. on the whole, the balance was nearly even; and, writing down a kind of conclusion in her mind which finished the sum for the present, at least, she changed the focus of her eyes, and saw nothing but the stars.  to-night they seemed fixed with unusual firmness in the blue, and flashed back such a ripple of light into her eyes that she found herself thinking that to-night the stars were happy. without knowing or caring more for church practices than most people of her age, katharine could not look into the sky at christmas time without feeling that, at this one season, the heavens bend over the earth with sympathy, and signal with immortal radiance that they, too, take part in her festival. somehow, it seemed to her that they were even now beholding the procession of kings and wise men upon some road on a distant part of the earth. and yet, after gazing for another second, the stars did their usual work upon the mind, froze to cinders the whole of our short human history, and reduced the human body to an ape-like, furry form, crouching amid the brushwood of a barbarous clod of mud. this stage was soon succeeded by another, in which there was nothing in the universe save stars and the light of stars; as she looked up the pupils of her eyes so dilated with starlight that the whole of her seemed dissolved in silver and spilt over the ledges of the stars for ever and ever indefinitely through space. somehow simultaneously, though incongruously, she was riding with the magnanimous hero upon the shore or under forest trees, and so might have continued were it not for the rebuke forcibly administered by the body, which, content with the normal conditions of life, in no way furthers any attempt on the part of the mind to alter them. she grew cold, shook herself, rose, and walked towards the house.  by the light of the stars, stogdon house looked pale and romantic, and about twice its natural size. built by a retired admiral in the early years of the nineteenth century, the curving bow windows of the front, now filled with reddish-yellow light, suggested a portly three-decker, sailing seas where those dolphins and narwhals who disport themselves upon the edges of old maps were scattered with an impartial hand. a semicircular flight of shallow steps led to a very large door, which katharine had left ajar. she hesitated, cast her eyes over the front of the house, marked that a light burnt in one small window upon an upper floor, and pushed the door open. for a moment she stood in the square hall, among many horned skulls, sallow globes, cracked oil-paintings, and stuffed owls, hesitating, it seemed, whether she should open the door on her right, through which the stir of life reached her ears. listening for a moment, she heard a sound which decided her, apparently, not to enter; her uncle, sir francis, was playing his nightly game of whist; it appeared probable that he was losing.  she went up the curving stairway, which represented the one attempt at ceremony in the otherwise rather dilapidated mansion, and down a narrow passage until she came to the room whose light she had seen from the garden. knocking, she was told to come in. a young man, henry otway, was reading, with his feet on the fender. he had a fine head, the brow arched in the elizabethan manner, but the gentle, honest eyes were rather skeptical than glowing with the elizabethan vigor. he gave the impression that he had not yet found the cause which suited his temperament.  he turned, put down his book, and looked at her. he noticed her rather pale, dew-drenched look, as of one whose mind is not altogether settled in the body. he had often laid his difficulties before her, and guessed, in some ways hoped, that perhaps she now had need of him. at the same time, she carried on her life with such independence that he scarcely expected any confidence to be expressed in words.  "
Match 987: " he said, looking at her cloak. katharine had forgotten to remove this token of her star-gazing.  "
Match 988: " she asked. "
Match 989: "  "
Match 990: " henry inquired, placing coal on the fire, drawing a chair up to the grate, and laying aside her cloak. her indifference to such details often forced henry to act the part generally taken by women in such dealings. it was one of the ties between them.  "
Match 991: " she said. "
Match 992: "  "
Match 993: " he replied. "
Match 994: "  "
Match 995: " katharine began, and stopped short. "
Match 996: " she added briefly, and sighed.  "
Match 997: " he agreed; and they both fell silent.  her sigh made him look at her. should he venture to ask her why she sighed? was her reticence about her own affairs as inviolable as it had often been convenient for rather an egoistical young man to think it? but since her engagement to rodney, henry's feeling towards her had become rather complex; equally divided between an impulse to hurt her and an impulse to be tender to her; and all the time he suffered a curious irritation from the sense that she was drifting away from him for ever upon unknown seas. on her side, directly katharine got into his presence, and the sense of the stars dropped from her, she knew that any intercourse between people is extremely partial; from the whole mass of her feelings, only one or two could be selected for henry's inspection, and therefore she sighed. then she looked at him, and their eyes meeting, much more seemed to be in common between them than had appeared possible. at any rate they had a grandfather in common; at any rate there was a kind of loyalty between them sometimes found between relations who have no other cause to like each other, as these two had.  "
Match 998: " said henry, the malicious mood now predominating.  "
Match 999: " she replied.  "
Match 1000: " he asked.  "
Match 1001: "  "
Match 1002: " he observed, stealing another look at her.  she lay back in her arm-chair, her feet high upon the side of the grate, and in front of her, presumably to screen her eyes, she held a newspaper from which she picked up a sentence or two now and again. observing this, henry remarked:  "
Match 1003: "  at this she lowered the newspaper an inch or two, but said nothing. indeed, she sat quite silent for over a minute.  "
Match 1004: " she said suddenly.  "
Match 1005: " henry replied. "
Match 1006: " he added, now observing her steadily.  "
Match 1007: " she replied rather hurriedly, not clearly understanding what he meant.  "
Match 1008: " he inquired, with a smile.  "
Match 1009: " she let drop in her casual, decided way.  "
Match 1010: " henry thought to himself.  "
Match 1011: " he said aloud, expressing what he supposed to be her attitude, much in her accent. perhaps she detected the imitation, for looking gently at him, she said, with ironical composure:  "
Match 1012: "  "
Match 1013: " he said shortly.  "
Match 1014: " she replied.  "
Match 1015: " he asked a moment later. "
Match 1016: "  she let this pass, either because she did not attend to it, or because the tone was not to her liking.  once more she paused, and then she inquired:  "
Match 1017: " she reflected. "
Match 1018: "  "
Match 1019: " henry protested.  "
Match 1020: " she replied vaguely, putting her feet on the ground, resting her chin on her hands, and looking out of her large dark eyes contemplatively at the fire.  "
Match 1021: " she added, as if by an afterthought.  henry very nearly laughed, but restrained himself.  "
Match 1022: " she asked, a moment later.  "
Match 1023: " he hazarded.  "
Match 1024: " she went on.  "
Match 1025: " he protested. "
Match 1026: "  tremendously to his surprise, he saw the tears stand in her eyes.  "
Match 1027: " she said. "
Match 1028: "  henry could not pretend that he was altogether ignorant of her meaning, though, certainly, he had never guessed that she minded the teasing. but before he knew what to say, her eyes were clear again, and the sudden crack in the surface was almost filled up.  "
Match 1029: " she stated.  obeying an impulse of genuine affection, henry spoke.  "
Match 1030: "  she seemed to consider, looking once more into the red of the fire, and decided to refrain from any explanation.  "
Match 1031: " she said at length, and henry felt himself gratified by her complete sincerity, and began to tell her now about the coal-mine, in obedience to her love of facts.  they were, indeed, descending the shaft in a small cage, and could hear the picks of the miners, something like the gnawing of rats, in the earth beneath them, when the door was burst open, without any knocking.  "
Match 1032: " rodney exclaimed. both katharine and henry turned round very quickly and rather guiltily. rodney was in evening dress. it was clear that his temper was ruffled.  "
Match 1033: " he repeated, looking at katharine.  "
Match 1034: " she replied.  "
Match 1035: "  she said nothing.  "
Match 1036: " henry asked.  rodney found it hard to be unreasonable in the presence of another man, and did not answer him.  "
Match 1037: " he said. "
Match 1038: "  "
Match 1039: " said henry urbanely.  "
Match 1040: " said katharine.  from the apparent determination to hurt him with which she spoke, henry thought that some sort of explosion on rodney's part was about to take place.  "
Match 1041: " said rodney, with his little chuckle, leaning over the back of his chair and tapping the woodwork lightly with his fingers. they were all silent, and the silence was acutely uncomfortable to henry, at least.  "
Match 1042: " katharine suddenly asked, with a complete change of tone and a little gesture of her hand.  "
Match 1043: " william said sulkily.  "
Match 1044: " she replied.  she rose as she spoke, and as she turned to leave the room, she laid her hand, with a curiously caressing gesture, upon rodney's shoulder. instantly rodney clasped her hand in his, with such an impulse of emotion that henry was annoyed, and rather ostentatiously opened a book.  "
Match 1045: " said william, as she drew back her hand, and made as if to pass him.  "
Match 1046: " she said hastily. "
Match 1047: "  "
Match 1048: " said henry, shutting up his book again. his invitation was polite, without being precisely cordial. rodney evidently hesitated as to the course he should pursue, but seeing katharine at the door, he exclaimed:  "
Match 1049: "  she looked back, and said in a very commanding tone, and with an expression of authority upon her face:  "
Match 1050: "  she nodded to them both, but henry could not help noticing that her last nod was in his direction. rodney sat down rather heavily.  his mortification was so obvious that henry scarcely liked to open the conversation with some remark of a literary character. on the other hand, unless he checked him, rodney might begin to talk about his feelings, and irreticence is apt to be extremely painful, at any rate in prospect. he therefore adopted a middle course; that is to say, he wrote a note upon the fly-leaf of his book, which ran, "
Match 1051: " this he decorated with those flourishes and decorative borders which grow of themselves upon these occasions; and as he did so, he thought to himself that whatever katharine's difficulties might be, they did not justify her behavior. she had spoken with a kind of brutality which suggested that, whether it is natural or assumed, women have a peculiar blindness to the feelings of men.  the penciling of this note gave rodney time to recover himself. perhaps, for he was a very vain man, he was more hurt that henry had seen him rebuffed than by the rebuff itself. he was in love with katharine, and vanity is not decreased but increased by love; especially, one may hazard, in the presence of one's own sex. but rodney enjoyed the courage which springs from that laughable and lovable defect, and when he had mastered his first impulse, in some way to make a fool of himself, he drew inspiration from the perfect fit of his evening dress. he chose a cigarette, tapped it on the back of his hand, displayed his exquisite pumps on the edge of the fender, and summoned his self-respect.  "
Match 1052: " he began. "
Match 1053: "  "
Match 1054: "  "
Match 1055: "  "
Match 1056: " he added, desiring to help rodney in his effort to recover his complacency.  "
Match 1057: " rodney replied. "
Match 1058: "  to tell the truth, henry labored under the same difficulty; he did not wish to introduce katharine's name, and, therefore, he replied vaguely that he had always heard that rodney was a great rider. in truth, he had heard very little about him, one way or another, accepting him as a figure often to be found in the background at his aunt's house, and inevitably, though inexplicably, engaged to his cousin.  "
Match 1059: " rodney continued; "
Match 1060: "  "
Match 1061: " henry remarked, rather shortly. but rodney, now started on an agreeable current of reflection, could not resist the temptation of pursuing it a little further. he appeared to himself as a man who moved easily in very good society, and knew enough about the true values of life to be himself above it.  "
Match 1062: " he went on. "
Match 1063: "  "
Match 1064: " henry thought to himself, with disgust. "
Match 1065: " his tolerance was rapidly becoming exhausted, but he could not help liking rodney nevertheless, and this appeared to him strange, for he was fastidious, and such words in another mouth would have condemned the speaker irreparably. he began, in short, to wonder what kind of creature this man who was to marry his cousin might be. could any one, except a rather singular character, afford to be so ridiculously vain?  "
Match 1066: " he replied. "
Match 1067: "  "
Match 1068: " rodney chuckled. "
Match 1069: "  "
Match 1070: " said henry, with an emphasis upon the name, almost as if he resented rodney's use of it, "
Match 1071: "  "
Match 1072: " rodney agreed. "
Match 1073: " he seemed about to describe her, and he hesitated for a long time. "
Match 1074: " he stated, or rather almost inquired, in a different tone from that in which he had been speaking. henry bent his head.  "
Match 1075: "  "
Match 1076: " said henry, with decision.  "
Match 1077: " rodney repeated, as if he weighed the meaning of the words. "
Match 1078: " he added, "
Match 1079: " he waited for henry to confirm this statement, but henry remained silent.  "
Match 1080: " he continued. "
Match 1081: "  "
Match 1082: " said henry, with decision.  "
Match 1083: "  rodney had completely dropped his pose as a man of the world, and seemed to be asking henry to help him in a difficulty.  "
Match 1084: " henry hesitated cautiously.  "
Match 1085: "  "
Match 1086: " henry stated.  "
Match 1087: " said rodney. "
Match 1088: "  "
Match 1089: " said henry. he paused. "
Match 1090: " he added, as if he were summing up his thoughts. "
Match 1091: "  "
Match 1092: " rodney inquired, as if he were eager for henry to continue. "
Match 1093: " he was going on, as henry remained silent, but the sentence was not finished, for the door opened, and they were interrupted by henry's younger brother gilbert, much to henry's relief, for he had already said more than he liked.    chapter xvii  when the sun shone, as it did with unusual brightness that christmas week, it revealed much that was faded and not altogether well-kept-up in stogdon house and its grounds. in truth, sir francis had retired from service under the government of india with a pension that was not adequate, in his opinion, to his services, as it certainly was not adequate to his ambitions. his career had not come up to his expectations, and although he was a very fine, white-whiskered, mahogany-colored old man to look at, and had laid down a very choice cellar of good reading and good stories, you could not long remain ignorant of the fact that some thunder-storm had soured them; he had a grievance. this grievance dated back to the middle years of the last century, when, owing to some official intrigue, his merits had been passed over in a disgraceful manner in favor of another, his junior.  the rights and wrongs of the story, presuming that they had some existence in fact, were no longer clearly known to his wife and children; but this disappointment had played a very large part in their lives, and had poisoned the life of sir francis much as a disappointment in love is said to poison the whole life of a woman. long brooding on his failure, continual arrangement and rearrangement of his deserts and rebuffs, had made sir francis much of an egoist, and in his retirement his temper became increasingly difficult and exacting.  his wife now offered so little resistance to his moods that she was practically useless to him. he made his daughter eleanor into his chief confidante, and the prime of her life was being rapidly consumed by her father. to her he dictated the memoirs which were to avenge his memory, and she had to assure him constantly that his treatment had been a disgrace. already, at the age of thirty-five, her cheeks were whitening as her mother's had whitened, but for her there would be no memories of indian suns and indian rivers, and clamor of children in a nursery; she would have very little of substance to think about when she sat, as lady otway now sat, knitting white wool, with her eyes fixed almost perpetually upon the same embroidered bird upon the same fire-screen. but then lady otway was one of the people for whom the great make-believe game of english social life has been invented; she spent most of her time in pretending to herself and her neighbors that she was a dignified, important, much-occupied person, of considerable social standing and sufficient wealth. in view of the actual state of things this game needed a great deal of skill; and, perhaps, at the age she had reached--she was over sixty--she played far more to deceive herself than to deceive any one else. moreover, the armor was wearing thin; she forgot to keep up appearances more and more.  the worn patches in the carpets, and the pallor of the drawing-room, where no chair or cover had been renewed for some years, were due not only to the miserable pension, but to the wear and tear of twelve children, eight of whom were sons. as often happens in these large families, a distinct dividing-line could be traced, about half-way in the succession, where the money for educational purposes had run short, and the six younger children had grown up far more economically than the elder. if the boys were clever, they won scholarships, and went to school; if they were not clever, they took what the family connection had to offer them. the girls accepted situations occasionally, but there were always one or two at home, nursing sick animals, tending silkworms, or playing the flute in their bedrooms. the distinction between the elder children and the younger corresponded almost to the distinction between a higher class and a lower one, for with only a haphazard education and insufficient allowances, the younger children had picked up accomplishments, friends, and points of view which were not to be found within the walls of a public school or of a government office. between the two divisions there was considerable hostility, the elder trying to patronize the younger, the younger refusing to respect the elder; but one feeling united them and instantly closed any risk of a breach--their common belief in the superiority of their own family to all others. henry was the eldest of the younger group, and their leader; he bought strange books and joined odd societies; he went without a tie for a whole year, and had six shirts made of black flannel. he had long refused to take a seat either in a shipping office or in a tea-merchant's warehouse; and persisted, in spite of the disapproval of uncles and aunts, in practicing both violin and piano, with the result that he could not perform professionally upon either. indeed, for thirty-two years of life he had nothing more substantial to show than a manuscript book containing the score of half an opera. in this protest of his, katharine had always given him her support, and as she was generally held to be an extremely sensible person, who dressed too well to be eccentric, he had found her support of some use. indeed, when she came down at christmas she usually spent a great part of her time in private conferences with henry and with cassandra, the youngest girl, to whom the silkworms belonged. with the younger section she had a great reputation for common sense, and for something that they despised but inwardly respected and called knowledge of the world--that is to say, of the way in which respectable elderly people, going to their clubs and dining out with ministers, think and behave. she had more than once played the part of ambassador between lady otway and her children. that poor lady, for instance, consulted her for advice when, one day, she opened cassandra's bedroom door on a mission of discovery, and found the ceiling hung with mulberry-leaves, the windows blocked with cages, and the tables stacked with home-made machines for the manufacture of silk dresses.  "
Match 1094: " she observed, rather plaintively, detailing her grievances. "
Match 1095: "  the morning was sufficiently bright to make the chairs and sofas in lady otway's private sitting-room appear more than usually shabby, and the gallant gentlemen, her brothers and cousins, who had defended the empire and left their bones on many frontiers, looked at the world through a film of yellow which the morning light seemed to have drawn across their photographs. lady otway sighed, it may be at the faded relics, and turned, with resignation, to her balls of wool, which, curiously and characteristically, were not an ivory-white, but rather a tarnished yellow-white. she had called her niece in for a little chat. she had always trusted her, and now more than ever, since her engagement to rodney, which seemed to lady otway extremely suitable, and just what one would wish for one's own daughter. katharine unwittingly increased her reputation for wisdom by asking to be given knitting-needles too.  "
Match 1096: " said lady otway, "
Match 1097: "  the emotions of the night before, which she had suppressed in such a way as to keep her awake till dawn, had left katharine a little jaded, and thus more matter-of-fact than usual. she was quite ready to discuss her plans--houses and rents, servants and economy--without feeling that they concerned her very much. as she spoke, knitting methodically meanwhile, lady otway noted, with approval, the upright, responsible bearing of her niece, to whom the prospect of marriage had brought some gravity most becoming in a bride, and yet, in these days, most rare. yes, katharine's engagement had changed her a little.  "
Match 1098: " she thought to herself, and could not help contrasting her with cassandra, surrounded by innumerable silkworms in her bedroom.  "
Match 1099: " she continued, glancing at katharine, with the round, greenish eyes which were as inexpressive as moist marbles, "
Match 1100: " but just as she was deriving satisfaction from this thought, and was producing some of the hoarded wisdom which none of her own daughters, alas! seemed now to need, the door opened, and mrs. hilbery came in, or rather, did not come in, but stood in the doorway and smiled, having evidently mistaken the room.  "
Match 1101: " she exclaimed. "
Match 1102: "  the presence of her sister-in-law made lady otway slightly uneasy. how could she go on with what she was saying in maggie's presence? for she was saying something that she had never said, all these years, to maggie herself.  "
Match 1103: " she said, with a little laugh. "
Match 1104: "  "
Match 1105: " said mrs. hilbery, coming into the room, and nodding her head once or twice, "
Match 1106: " she added, giving her sister-in-law a little pat, which made lady otway more uncomfortable still. she half laughed, muttered something, and ended on a sigh.  "
Match 1107: " said katharine, framing her aunt's words into a far more definite shape than they had really worn; and when she spoke thus she did not appear at all old-fashioned. lady otway looked at her and paused for a moment.  "
Match 1108: " she said, beginning a fresh row rather elaborately.  mrs. hilbery knew something of the circumstances which, as she thought, had inspired this remark. in a moment her face was clouded with sympathy which she did not quite know how to express.  "
Match 1109: " she exclaimed, forgetting that her train of thought might not be obvious to her listeners. "
Match 1110: " she concluded, looking at katharine, "
Match 1111: "  lady otway, who was mr. hilbery's sister, knew quite well that, in private, the hilberys called sir francis "
Match 1112: " and though she did not follow the drift of mrs. hilbery's remarks, she knew what prompted them.  "
Match 1113: " she said, speaking to katharine, as if there were a separate understanding between them, "
Match 1114: "  "
Match 1115: " said katharine, "
Match 1116: " she did not mean to finish her sentence, she merely wished to induce her mother and her aunt to go on talking about marriage, for she was in the mood to feel that other people could help her if they would. she went on knitting, but her fingers worked with a decision that was oddly unlike the smooth and contemplative sweep of lady otway's plump hand. now and then she looked swiftly at her mother, then at her aunt. mrs. hilbery held a book in her hand, and was on her way, as katharine guessed, to the library, where another paragraph was to be added to that varied assortment of paragraphs, the life of richard alardyce. normally, katharine would have hurried her mother downstairs, and seen that no excuse for distraction came her way. her attitude towards the poet's life, however, had changed with other changes; and she was content to forget all about her scheme of hours. mrs. hilbery was secretly delighted. her relief at finding herself excused manifested itself in a series of sidelong glances of sly humor in her daughter's direction, and the indulgence put her in the best of spirits. was she to be allowed merely to sit and talk? it was so much pleasanter to sit in a nice room filled with all sorts of interesting odds and ends which she hadn't looked at for a year, at least, than to seek out one date which contradicted another in a dictionary.  "
Match 1117: " she concluded, generously forgiving sir francis all his faults in a lump. "
Match 1118: " she corrected herself, with a glance obviously in the direction of sir francis. "
Match 1119: " and here she sighed, and suggested that, perhaps, she ought to go down to the library.  "
Match 1120: " said katharine, taking no notice of her mother's suggestion, blind even to the depression which had now taken possession of her at the thought of her own inevitable death.  "
Match 1121: " said lady otway, with a decision most unusual for her.  "
Match 1122: " katharine mused, seeming to address herself.  mrs. hilbery was not much interested in these remarks, which seemed to have a melancholy tendency, and to revive her spirits she had recourse to an infallible remedy--she looked out of the window.  "
Match 1123: " she exclaimed, and her eye looked with extreme pleasure at the soft sky. at the trees, at the green fields visible behind those trees, and at the leafless branches which surrounded the body of the small blue tit. her sympathy with nature was exquisite.  "
Match 1124: " lady otway slipped in quickly, in rather a low voice, as if she wanted to get this said while her sister-in-law's attention was diverted. "
Match 1125: "  "
Match 1126: " said mrs. hilbery, catching the word marriage, as she brought her eyes back to the room again. then she turned her mind to what she had said.  "
Match 1127: " she corrected herself. she looked at her daughter with a look of vague alarm. it was the kind of maternal scrutiny which suggests that, in looking at her daughter a mother is really looking at herself. she was not altogether satisfied; but she purposely made no attempt to break down the reserve which, as a matter of fact, was a quality she particularly admired and depended upon in her daughter. but when her mother said that marriage was the most interesting life, katharine felt, as she was apt to do suddenly, for no definite reason, that they understood each other, in spite of differing in every possible way. yet the wisdom of the old seems to apply more to feelings which we have in common with the rest of the human race than to our feelings as individuals, and katharine knew that only some one of her own age could follow her meaning. both these elderly women seemed to her to have been content with so little happiness, and at the moment she had not sufficient force to feel certain that their version of marriage was the wrong one. in london, certainly, this temperate attitude toward her own marriage had seemed to her just. why had she now changed? why did it now depress her? it never occurred to her that her own conduct could be anything of a puzzle to her mother, or that elder people are as much affected by the young as the young are by them. and yet it was true that love--passion--whatever one chose to call it, had played far less part in mrs. hilbery's life than might have seemed likely, judging from her enthusiastic and imaginative temperament. she had always been more interested by other things. lady otway, strange though it seemed, guessed more accurately at katharine's state of mind than her mother did.  "
Match 1128: " exclaimed mrs. hilbery, once more looking out of the window. "
Match 1129: "  "
Match 1130: " said lady otway. "
Match 1131: " she continued, touching the bell.  "
Match 1132: " said mrs. hilbery, feeling herself unable to prefer one hour to another. "
Match 1133: "  at this katharine shivered a little, drew up to the fire, and warmed her hands by spreading them over the topmost peak of the coal. she wished to bring the talk back to marriage again, in order to hear aunt charlotte's views, but she did not know how to do this.  "
Match 1134: " she said, noticing her own.  she took the cluster of green stones and turned it round and round, but she did not know what to say next.  "
Match 1135: " lady otway mused. "
Match 1136: "  katharine turned the ring round once more, and gave it back to her aunt without speaking. and while she turned it round her lips set themselves firmly together, and it seemed to her that she could satisfy william as these women had satisfied their husbands; she could pretend to like emeralds when she preferred diamonds. having replaced her ring, lady otway remarked that it was chilly, though not more so than one must expect at this time of year. indeed, one ought to be thankful to see the sun at all, and she advised them both to dress warmly for their drive. her aunt's stock of commonplaces, katharine sometimes suspected, had been laid in on purpose to fill silences with, and had little to do with her private thoughts. but at this moment they seemed terribly in keeping with her own conclusions, so that she took up her knitting again and listened, chiefly with a view to confirming herself in the belief that to be engaged to marry some one with whom you are not in love is an inevitable step in a world where the existence of passion is only a traveller's story brought from the heart of deep forests and told so rarely that wise people doubt whether the story can be true. she did her best to listen to her mother asking for news of john, and to her aunt replying with the authentic history of hilda's engagement to an officer in the indian army, but she cast her mind alternately towards forest paths and starry blossoms, and towards pages of neatly written mathematical signs. when her mind took this turn her marriage seemed no more than an archway through which it was necessary to pass in order to have her desire. at such times the current of her nature ran in its deep narrow channel with great force and with an alarming lack of consideration for the feelings of others. just as the two elder ladies had finished their survey of the family prospects, and lady otway was nervously anticipating some general statement as to life and death from her sister-in-law, cassandra burst into the room with the news that the carriage was at the door.  "
Match 1137: " said lady otway, peevishly, blaming her servants for not living up to her ideals.  when mrs. hilbery and katharine arrived in the hall, ready dressed for their drive, they found that the usual discussion was going forward as to the plans of the rest of the family. in token of this, a great many doors were opening and shutting, two or three people stood irresolutely on the stairs, now going a few steps up, and now a few steps down, and sir francis himself had come out from his study, with the "
Match 1138: " under his arm, and a complaint about noise and draughts from the open door which, at least, had the effect of bundling the people who did not want to go into the carriage, and sending those who did not want to stay back to their rooms. it was decided that mrs. hilbery, katharine, rodney, and henry should drive to lincoln, and any one else who wished to go should follow on bicycles or in the pony-cart. every one who stayed at stogdon house had to make this expedition to lincoln in obedience to lady otway's conception of the right way to entertain her guests, which she had imbibed from reading in fashionable papers of the behavior of christmas parties in ducal houses. the carriage horses were both fat and aged, still they matched; the carriage was shaky and uncomfortable, but the otway arms were visible on the panels. lady otway stood on the topmost step, wrapped in a white shawl, and waved her hand almost mechanically until they had turned the corner under the laurel-bushes, when she retired indoors with a sense that she had played her part, and a sigh at the thought that none of her children felt it necessary to play theirs.  the carriage bowled along smoothly over the gently curving road. mrs. hilbery dropped into a pleasant, inattentive state of mind, in which she was conscious of the running green lines of the hedges, of the swelling ploughland, and of the mild blue sky, which served her, after the first five minutes, for a pastoral background to the drama of human life; and then she thought of a cottage garden, with the flash of yellow daffodils against blue water; and what with the arrangement of these different prospects, and the shaping of two or three lovely phrases, she did not notice that the young people in the carriage were almost silent. henry, indeed, had been included against his wish, and revenged himself by observing katharine and rodney with disillusioned eyes; while katharine was in a state of gloomy self-suppression which resulted in complete apathy. when rodney spoke to her she either said "
Match 1139: " or assented so listlessly that he addressed his next remark to her mother. his deference was agreeable to her, his manners were exemplary; and when the church towers and factory chimneys of the town came into sight, she roused herself, and recalled memories of the fair summer of 1853, which fitted in harmoniously with what she was dreaming of the future.    chapter xviii  but other passengers were approaching lincoln meanwhile by other roads on foot. a county town draws the inhabitants of all vicarages, farms, country houses, and wayside cottages, within a radius of ten miles at least, once or twice a week to its streets; and among them, on this occasion, were ralph denham and mary datchet. they despised the roads, and took their way across the fields; and yet, from their appearance, it did not seem as if they cared much where they walked so long as the way did not actually trip them up. when they left the vicarage, they had begun an argument which swung their feet along so rhythmically in time with it that they covered the ground at over four miles an hour, and saw nothing of the hedgerows, the swelling plowland, or the mild blue sky. what they saw were the houses of parliament and the government offices in whitehall. they both belonged to the class which is conscious of having lost its birthright in these great structures and is seeking to build another kind of lodging for its own notion of law and government. purposely, perhaps, mary did not agree with ralph; she loved to feel her mind in conflict with his, and to be certain that he spared her female judgment no ounce of his male muscularity. he seemed to argue as fiercely with her as if she were his brother. they were alike, however, in believing that it behooved them to take in hand the repair and reconstruction of the fabric of england. they agreed in thinking that nature has not been generous in the endowment of our councilors. they agreed, unconsciously, in a mute love for the muddy field through which they tramped, with eyes narrowed close by the concentration of their minds. at length they drew breath, let the argument fly away into the limbo of other good arguments, and, leaning over a gate, opened their eyes for the first time and looked about them. their feet tingled with warm blood and their breath rose in steam around them. the bodily exercise made them both feel more direct and less self-conscious than usual, and mary, indeed, was overcome by a sort of light-headedness which made it seem to her that it mattered very little what happened next. it mattered so little, indeed, that she felt herself on the point of saying to ralph:  "
Match 1140: " at the moment, however, speech or silence seemed immaterial, and she merely clapped her hands together, and looked at the distant woods with the rust-like bloom on their brown, and the green and blue landscape through the steam of her own breath. it seemed a mere toss-up whether she said, "
Match 1141: " or whether she said, "
Match 1142: " or only "
Match 1143: "  "
Match 1144: " ralph suddenly interrupted her, "
Match 1145: "  her indifference must have been superficial, for it disappeared at once. indeed, she lost sight of the trees, and saw her own hand upon the topmost bar of the gate with extreme distinctness, while he went on:  "
Match 1146: " he spoke with an assumption of carelessness as if expecting her to dissuade him.  she still waited, as if for him to continue; she was convinced that in some roundabout way he approached the subject of their marriage.  "
Match 1147: " he proceeded. "
Match 1148: "  "
Match 1149: " she asked.  "
Match 1150: " he replied. "
Match 1151: " he went on, and opened the gate with a jerk. they began to cross the next field walking side by side.  "
Match 1152: "  by this time mary had recovered her self-control.  "
Match 1153: " she said.  "
Match 1154: " he asked, with some surprise.  "
Match 1155: " she asked.  "
Match 1156: " said ralph, slackening his pace and remembering katharine and her engagement, the purple leaves stamped into the path, the white paper radiant under the electric light, and the hopelessness which seemed to surround all these things.  "
Match 1157: " he said, with something of an effort, "
Match 1158: "  she was silent, hoping that he might tell her the reason of his unhappiness, for his excuses had not deceived her.  "
Match 1159: " he repeated. some six weeks separated him from that afternoon when he had sat upon the embankment watching his visions dissolve in mist as the waters swam past and the sense of his desolation still made him shiver. he had not recovered in the least from that depression. here was an opportunity for making himself face it, as he felt that he ought to; for, by this time, no doubt, it was only a sentimental ghost, better exorcised by ruthless exposure to such an eye as mary's, than allowed to underlie all his actions and thoughts as had been the case ever since he first saw katharine hilbery pouring out tea. he must begin, however, by mentioning her name, and this he found it impossible to do. he persuaded himself that he could make an honest statement without speaking her name; he persuaded himself that his feeling had very little to do with her.  "
Match 1160: " he said, "
Match 1161: "  this rather stilted beginning did not please him, and it became more and more obvious to him that, whatever he might say, his unhappiness had been directly caused by katharine.  "
Match 1162: " he started afresh. "
Match 1163: " he paused again, but felt that this, at any rate, was true, and that on these lines he could go on.  "
Match 1164: "--for a good reason now occurred to him--"
Match 1165: "  there were two reasons that kept mary very silent during this speech, and drew curiously straight lines upon her face. in the first place, ralph made no mention of marriage; in the second, he was not speaking the truth.  "
Match 1166: " she said, with cheerful hardness, ignoring the whole of this statement. "
Match 1167: " she concluded, "
Match 1168: "  they crossed the field in complete silence. ralph was surprised by her remark and a little hurt, and yet, on the whole, rather pleased. he had convinced himself that it was impossible to lay his case truthfully before mary, and, secretly, he was relieved to find that he had not parted with his dream to her. she was, as he had always found her, the sensible, loyal friend, the woman he trusted; whose sympathy he could count upon, provided he kept within certain limits. he was not displeased to find that those limits were very clearly marked. when they had crossed the next hedge she said to him:  "
Match 1169: " she cried. "
Match 1170: "  if she meant consciously or unconsciously to belittle the seclusion and security of a country cottage, she did not succeed; for ralph's determination was genuine. but she made him visualize her in her own character, so that he looked quickly at her, as she walked a little in front of him across the plowed field; for the first time that morning he saw her independently of him or of his preoccupation with katharine. he seemed to see her marching ahead, a rather clumsy but powerful and independent figure, for whose courage he felt the greatest respect.  "
Match 1171: " he exclaimed, and stopped.  "
Match 1172: " she returned, without looking at him. "
Match 1173: "  "
Match 1174: " he cried, stung by the remembrance of his exacting and dictatorial ways with her, "
Match 1175: "  it took all her strength to keep the tears from springing, and to thrust back her assurance that she would forgive him till doomsday if he chose. she was preserved from doing so only by a stubborn kind of respect for herself which lay at the root of her nature and forbade surrender, even in moments of almost overwhelming passion. now, when all was tempest and high-running waves, she knew of a land where the sun shone clear upon italian grammars and files of docketed papers. nevertheless, from the skeleton pallor of that land and the rocks that broke its surface, she knew that her life there would be harsh and lonely almost beyond endurance. she walked steadily a little in front of him across the plowed field. their way took them round the verge of a wood of thin trees standing at the edge of a steep fold in the land. looking between the tree-trunks, ralph saw laid out on the perfectly flat and richly green meadow at the bottom of the hill a small gray manor-house, with ponds, terraces, and clipped hedges in front of it, a farm building or so at the side, and a screen of fir-trees rising behind, all perfectly sheltered and self-sufficient. behind the house the hill rose again, and the trees on the farther summit stood upright against the sky, which appeared of a more intense blue between their trunks. his mind at once was filled with a sense of the actual presence of katharine; the gray house and the intense blue sky gave him the feeling of her presence close by. he leant against a tree, forming her name beneath his breath:  "
Match 1176: " he said aloud, and then, looking round, saw mary walking slowly away from him, tearing a long spray of ivy from the trees as she passed them. she seemed so definitely opposed to the vision he held in his mind that he returned to it with a gesture of impatience.  "
Match 1177: " he repeated, and seemed to himself to be with her. he lost his sense of all that surrounded him; all substantial things--the hour of the day, what we have done and are about to do, the presence of other people and the support we derive from seeing their belief in a common reality--all this slipped from him. so he might have felt if the earth had dropped from his feet, and the empty blue had hung all round him, and the air had been steeped in the presence of one woman. the chirp of a robin on the bough above his head awakened him, and his awakenment was accompanied by a sigh. here was the world in which he had lived; here the plowed field, the high road yonder, and mary, stripping ivy from the trees. when he came up with her he linked his arm through hers and said:  "
Match 1178: "  there was a brotherly kindness in his voice which seemed to her magnanimous, when she reflected that she had cut short his explanations and shown little interest in his change of plan. she gave him her reasons for thinking that she might profit by such a journey, omitting the one reason which had set all the rest in motion. he listened attentively, and made no attempt to dissuade her. in truth, he found himself curiously eager to make certain of her good sense, and accepted each fresh proof of it with satisfaction, as though it helped him to make up his mind about something. she forgot the pain he had caused her, and in place of it she became conscious of a steady tide of well-being which harmonized very aptly with the tramp of their feet upon the dry road and the support of his arm. the comfort was the more glowing in that it seemed to be the reward of her determination to behave to him simply and without attempting to be other than she was. instead of making out an interest in the poets, she avoided them instinctively, and dwelt rather insistently upon the practical nature of her gifts.  in a practical way she asked for particulars of his cottage, which hardly existed in his mind, and corrected his vagueness.  "
Match 1179: " she insisted, with an exaggeration of interest. she avoided asking him what he meant to do in this cottage, and, at last, when all the practical details had been thrashed out as much as possible, he rewarded her by a more intimate statement.  "
Match 1180: " he said, "
Match 1181: " here he withdrew his arm from hers, lit his pipe, and they tramped on in a sagacious kind of comradeship, the most complete they had attained in all their friendship.  "
Match 1182: " she said, as boldly as if she had never come to grief with ralph in talking about books. he told her unhesitatingly that he meant to write the history of the english village from saxon days to the present time. some such plan had lain as a seed in his mind for many years; and now that he had decided, in a flash, to give up his profession, the seed grew in the space of twenty minutes both tall and lusty. he was surprised himself at the positive way in which he spoke. it was the same with the question of his cottage. that had come into existence, too, in an unromantic shape--a square white house standing just off the high road, no doubt, with a neighbor who kept a pig and a dozen squalling children; for these plans were shorn of all romance in his mind, and the pleasure he derived from thinking of them was checked directly it passed a very sober limit. so a sensible man who has lost his chance of some beautiful inheritance might tread out the narrow bounds of his actual dwelling-place, and assure himself that life is supportable within its demesne, only one must grow turnips and cabbages, not melons and pomegranates. certainly ralph took some pride in the resources of his mind, and was insensibly helped to right himself by mary's trust in him. she wound her ivy spray round her ash-plant, and for the first time for many days, when alone with ralph, set no spies upon her motives, sayings, and feelings, but surrendered herself to complete happiness.  thus talking, with easy silences and some pauses to look at the view over the hedge and to decide upon the species of a little gray-brown bird slipping among the twigs, they walked into lincoln, and after strolling up and down the main street, decided upon an inn where the rounded window suggested substantial fare, nor were they mistaken. for over a hundred and fifty years hot joints, potatoes, greens, and apple puddings had been served to generations of country gentlemen, and now, sitting at a table in the hollow of the bow window, ralph and mary took their share of this perennial feast. looking across the joint, half-way through the meal, mary wondered whether ralph would ever come to look quite like the other people in the room. would he be absorbed among the round pink faces, pricked with little white bristles, the calves fitted in shiny brown leather, the black-and-white check suits, which were sprinkled about in the same room with them? she half hoped so; she thought that it was only in his mind that he was different. she did not wish him to be too different from other people. the walk had given him a ruddy color, too, and his eyes were lit up by a steady, honest light, which could not make the simplest farmer feel ill at ease, or suggest to the most devout of clergymen a disposition to sneer at his faith. she loved the steep cliff of his forehead, and compared it to the brow of a young greek horseman, who reins his horse back so sharply that it half falls on its haunches. he always seemed to her like a rider on a spirited horse. and there was an exaltation to her in being with him, because there was a risk that he would not be able to keep to the right pace among other people. sitting opposite him at the little table in the window, she came back to that state of careless exaltation which had overcome her when they halted by the gate, but now it was accompanied by a sense of sanity and security, for she felt that they had a feeling in common which scarcely needed embodiment in words. how silent he was! leaning his forehead on his hand, now and then, and again looking steadily and gravely at the backs of the two men at the next table, with so little self-consciousness that she could almost watch his mind placing one thought solidly upon the top of another; she thought that she could feel him thinking, through the shade of her fingers, and she could anticipate the exact moment when he would put an end to his thought and turn a little in his chair and say:  "
Match 1183: " inviting her to take up the thread of thought where he had dropped it.  and at that very moment he turned just so, and said:  "
Match 1184: " with the curious touch of diffidence which she loved in him.  she laughed, and she explained her laugh on the spur of the moment by the look of the people in the street below. there was a motor-car with an old lady swathed in blue veils, and a lady's maid on the seat opposite, holding a king charles's spaniel; there was a country-woman wheeling a perambulator full of sticks down the middle of the road; there was a bailiff in gaiters discussing the state of the cattle market with a dissenting minister--so she defined them.  she ran over this list without any fear that her companion would think her trivial. indeed, whether it was due to the warmth of the room or to the good roast beef, or whether ralph had achieved the process which is called making up one's mind, certainly he had given up testing the good sense, the independent character, the intelligence shown in her remarks. he had been building one of those piles of thought, as ramshackle and fantastic as a chinese pagoda, half from words let fall by gentlemen in gaiters, half from the litter in his own mind, about duck shooting and legal history, about the roman occupation of lincoln and the relations of country gentlemen with their wives, when, from all this disconnected rambling, there suddenly formed itself in his mind the idea that he would ask mary to marry him. the idea was so spontaneous that it seemed to shape itself of its own accord before his eyes. it was then that he turned round and made use of his old, instinctive phrase:  "
Match 1185: "  as it presented itself to him at first, the idea was so new and interesting that he was half inclined to address it, without more ado, to mary herself. his natural instinct to divide his thoughts carefully into two different classes before he expressed them to her prevailed. but as he watched her looking out of the window and describing the old lady, the woman with the perambulator, the bailiff and the dissenting minister, his eyes filled involuntarily with tears. he would have liked to lay his head on her shoulder and sob, while she parted his hair with her fingers and soothed him and said:  "
Match 1186: "; and they would clasp each other tight, and her arms would hold him like his mother's. he felt that he was very lonely, and that he was afraid of the other people in the room.  "
Match 1187: " he exclaimed abruptly.  "
Match 1188: " she replied, rather vaguely, still looking out of the window.  he resented this divided attention more than, perhaps, he knew, and he thought how mary would soon be on her way to america.  "
Match 1189: " he said, "
Match 1190: "  mary felt his agitation without looking at him; she felt convinced that she knew what it was that he wished to say to her.  "
Match 1191: " she said; and felt it necessary to display her extreme calmness by lifting a salt-cellar and sweeping up a little heap of bread-crumbs.  "
Match 1192: " ralph continued, not quite knowing what he was about to say, but feeling some curious instinct which urged him to commit himself irrevocably, and to prevent the moment of intimacy from passing.  "
Match 1193: "  "
Match 1194: " she said.  at this point the waiter changed their plates.  "
Match 1195: " he said, looking fixedly at the table-cloth. "
Match 1196: " he said energetically, although forced to keep his voice low.  "
Match 1197: " and by a nod of his head he indicated the other occupants of the room, "
Match 1198: "  "
Match 1199: " said mary, in the same low and very earnest tones, which, in spite of being almost inaudible, surrounded their table with an atmosphere of concentration which was quite perceptible to the other diners, who glanced at them now and then with a queer mixture of kindness, amusement, and curiosity.  "
Match 1200: " here she hesitated, and glanced at him, as if to ascertain what his passion was for--"
Match 1201: " she added, as if she had found what she sought indisputably.  "
Match 1202: " ralph repeated obstinately.  "
Match 1203: " she said impatiently. "
Match 1204: "--she was surprised to find herself speaking the word, and had to force herself to speak it out--"
Match 1205: " her voice sank, became inaudible, and wavered as if she could scarcely keep herself from tears.  "
Match 1206: " ralph exclaimed to himself. "
Match 1207: "  the certainty overwhelmed him so that he scarcely knew what he was doing; the blood rushed to his cheeks, and although he had quite made up his mind to ask her to marry him, the certainty that she loved him seemed to change the situation so completely that he could not do it. he did not dare to look at her. if she cried, he did not know what he should do. it seemed to him that something of a terrible and devastating nature had happened. the waiter changed their plates once more.  in his agitation ralph rose, turned his back upon mary, and looked out of the window. the people in the street seemed to him only a dissolving and combining pattern of black particles; which, for the moment, represented very well the involuntary procession of feelings and thoughts which formed and dissolved in rapid succession in his own mind. at one moment he exulted in the thought that mary loved him; at the next, it seemed that he was without feeling for her; her love was repulsive to him. now he felt urged to marry her at once; now to disappear and never see her again. in order to control this disorderly race of thought he forced himself to read the name on the chemist's shop directly opposite him; then to examine the objects in the shop windows, and then to focus his eyes exactly upon a little group of women looking in at the great windows of a large draper's shop. this discipline having given him at least a superficial control of himself, he was about to turn and ask the waiter to bring the bill, when his eye was caught by a tall figure walking quickly along the opposite pavement--a tall figure, upright, dark, and commanding, much detached from her surroundings. she held her gloves in her left hand, and the left hand was bare. all this ralph noticed and enumerated and recognized before he put a name to the whole--katharine hilbery. she seemed to be looking for somebody. her eyes, in fact, scanned both sides of the street, and for one second were raised directly to the bow window in which ralph stood; but she looked away again instantly without giving any sign that she had seen him. this sudden apparition had an extraordinary effect upon him. it was as if he had thought of her so intensely that his mind had formed the shape of her, rather than that he had seen her in the flesh outside in the street. and yet he had not been thinking of her at all. the impression was so intense that he could not dismiss it, nor even think whether he had seen her or merely imagined her. he sat down at once, and said, briefly and strangely, rather to himself than to mary:  "
Match 1208: "  "
Match 1209: " she asked, hardly understanding from his manner whether he had seen her or not.  "
Match 1210: " he repeated. "
Match 1211: "  "
Match 1212: " mary thought, in an instant of blinding revelation; "
Match 1213: " she knew it all now.  after a moment of downcast stupor, she raised her eyes, looked steadily at ralph, and caught his fixed and dreamy gaze leveled at a point far beyond their surroundings, a point that she had never reached in all the time that she had known him. she noticed the lips just parted, the fingers loosely clenched, the whole attitude of rapt contemplation, which fell like a veil between them. she noticed everything about him; if there had been other signs of his utter alienation she would have sought them out, too, for she felt that it was only by heaping one truth upon another that she could keep herself sitting there, upright. the truth seemed to support her; it struck her, even as she looked at his face, that the light of truth was shining far away beyond him; the light of truth, she seemed to frame the words as she rose to go, shines on a world not to be shaken by our personal calamities.  ralph handed her her coat and her stick. she took them, fastened the coat securely, grasped the stick firmly. the ivy spray was still twisted about the handle; this one sacrifice, she thought, she might make to sentimentality and personality, and she picked two leaves from the ivy and put them in her pocket before she disencumbered her stick of the rest of it. she grasped the stick in the middle, and settled her fur cap closely upon her head, as if she must be in trim for a long and stormy walk. next, standing in the middle of the road, she took a slip of paper from her purse, and read out loud a list of commissions entrusted to her--fruit, butter, string, and so on; and all the time she never spoke directly to ralph or looked at him.  ralph heard her giving orders to attentive, rosy-checked men in white aprons, and in spite of his own preoccupation, he commented upon the determination with which she made her wishes known. once more he began, automatically, to take stock of her characteristics. standing thus, superficially observant and stirring the sawdust on the floor meditatively with the toe of his boot, he was roused by a musical and familiar voice behind him, accompanied by a light touch upon his shoulder.  "
Match 1214: "  it was mrs. hilbery; her entrance created some stir in the shop; many people looked at her.  "
Match 1215: " she demanded, but, catching sight of the attentive shopman, she appealed to him. "
Match 1216: "  "
Match 1217: " she continued, having received the information and the pot of honey, having been introduced to mary, and having insisted that they should accompany her back to the ruins, since in a town with so many turnings, such prospects, such delightful little half-naked boys dabbling in pools, such venetian canals, such old blue china in the curiosity shops, it was impossible for one person all alone to find her way to the ruins. "
Match 1218: " she exclaimed, "
Match 1219: " she inquired, gazing at him with a sudden suspicion of her own accuracy. "
Match 1220: "  they had reached the roman arch when mrs. hilbery caught sight of her own party, standing like sentinels facing up and down the road so as to intercept her if, as they expected, she had got lodged in some shop.  "
Match 1221: " she exclaimed. "
Match 1222: " could they not somehow revoke that meal?  katharine, who had gone a few steps by herself down the road, and was investigating the window of an ironmonger, as if her mother might have got herself concealed among mowing-machines and garden-shears, turned sharply on hearing her voice, and came towards them. she was a great deal surprised to see denham and mary datchet. whether the cordiality with which she greeted them was merely that which is natural to a surprise meeting in the country, or whether she was really glad to see them both, at any rate she exclaimed with unusual pleasure as she shook hands:  "
Match 1223: " she continued, turning to ralph. "
Match 1224: "  thus confronted at a distance of only a few feet by the real body of the woman about whom he had dreamt so many million dreams, ralph stammered; he made a clutch at his self-control; the color either came to his cheeks or left them, he knew not which; but he was determined to face her and track down in the cold light of day whatever vestige of truth there might be in his persistent imaginations. he did not succeed in saying anything. it was mary who spoke for both of them. he was struck dumb by finding that katharine was quite different, in some strange way, from his memory, so that he had to dismiss his old view in order to accept the new one. the wind was blowing her crimson scarf across her face; the wind had already loosened her hair, which looped across the corner of one of the large, dark eyes which, so he used to think, looked sad; now they looked bright with the brightness of the sea struck by an unclouded ray; everything about her seemed rapid, fragmentary, and full of a kind of racing speed. he realized suddenly that he had never seen her in the daylight before.  meanwhile, it was decided that it was too late to go in search of ruins as they had intended; and the whole party began to walk towards the stables where the carriage had been put up.  "
Match 1225: " said katharine, keeping slightly in advance of the rest with ralph, "
Match 1226: "  "
Match 1227: " he replied.  this remark, and the rough strain in his voice, recalled to her memory so many difficult speeches and abortive meetings that she was jerked directly back to the london drawing-room, the family relics, and the tea-table; and at the same time recalled some half-finished or interrupted remark which she had wanted to make herself or to hear from him--she could not remember what it was.  "
Match 1228: " she said. "
Match 1229: " she glanced back and saw that the others were following obediently, listening to certain memories of lincoln upon which mrs. hilbery had started. "
Match 1230: " she asked.  "
Match 1231: "  "
Match 1232: " she exclaimed, almost standing still in her surprise, "
Match 1233: " it flashed across her mind that he must already be engaged to mary.  "
Match 1234: "  "
Match 1235: " she asked. she answered herself at once, with a curious change from rapid speech to an almost melancholy tone. "
Match 1236: "  at this very moment, when her words seemed to be striking a path into the future for him, they stepped into the yard of an inn, and there beheld the family coach of the otways, to which one sleek horse was already attached, while the second was being led out of the stable door by the hostler.  "
Match 1237: " he said briefly, having to step aside in order to avoid a groom with a bucket. "
Match 1238: "  she could not answer because they were immediately surrounded by other members of the party--by mrs. hilbery, and mary, henry otway, and william.  rodney went up to katharine immediately and said to her:  "
Match 1239: "  katharine nodded her head. she glanced at him with an oddly furtive expression.  "
Match 1240: " he continued to denham. his manner was unusually peremptory; he seemed anxious to hasten the departure, and katharine looked at him from time to time, as denham noticed, with an expression half of inquiry, half of annoyance. she at once helped her mother into her cloak, and said to mary:  "
Match 1241: " she half smiled at ralph, but her look was a little overcast by something she was thinking, and in a very few minutes the otway carriage rolled out of the stable yard and turned down the high road leading to the village of lampsher.  the return drive was almost as silent as the drive from home had been in the morning; indeed, mrs. hilbery leant back with closed eyes in her corner, and either slept or feigned sleep, as her habit was in the intervals between the seasons of active exertion, or continued the story which she had begun to tell herself that morning.  about two miles from lampsher the road ran over the rounded summit of the heath, a lonely spot marked by an obelisk of granite, setting forth the gratitude of some great lady of the eighteenth century who had been set upon by highwaymen at this spot and delivered from death just as hope seemed lost. in summer it was a pleasant place, for the deep woods on either side murmured, and the heather, which grew thick round the granite pedestal, made the light breeze taste sweetly; in winter the sighing of the trees was deepened to a hollow sound, and the heath was as gray and almost as solitary as the empty sweep of the clouds above it.  here rodney stopped the carriage and helped katharine to alight. henry, too, gave her his hand, and fancied that she pressed it very slightly in parting as if she sent him a message. but the carriage rolled on immediately, without wakening mrs. hilbery, and left the couple standing by the obelisk. that rodney was angry with her and had made this opportunity for speaking to her, katharine knew very well; she was neither glad nor sorry that the time had come, nor, indeed, knew what to expect, and thus remained silent. the carriage grew smaller and smaller upon the dusky road, and still rodney did not speak. perhaps, she thought, he waited until the last sign of the carriage had disappeared beneath the curve of the road and they were left entirely alone. to cloak their silence she read the writing on the obelisk, to do which she had to walk completely round it. she was murmuring a word to two of the pious lady's thanks above her breath when rodney joined her. in silence they set out along the cart-track which skirted the verge of the trees.  to break the silence was exactly what rodney wished to do, and yet could not do to his own satisfaction. in company it was far easier to approach katharine; alone with her, the aloofness and force of her character checked all his natural methods of attack. he believed that she had behaved very badly to him, but each separate instance of unkindness seemed too petty to be advanced when they were alone together.  "
Match 1242: " he complained at last; upon which she immediately slackened her pace, and walked too slowly to suit him. in desperation he said the first thing he thought of, very peevishly and without the dignified prelude which he had intended.  "
Match 1243: "  "
Match 1244: "  "
Match 1245: "  "
Match 1246: " she counted.  "
Match 1247: " he blurted out, for his irritation rose as she spoke, and got the better of his awe of her, and was inflamed by that awe.  "
Match 1248: " she said calmly.  "
Match 1249: " he went on. "
Match 1250: "  she noted these various complaints and determined philosophically to answer none of them, although the last stung her to considerable irritation. she wished to find out how deep his grievance lay.  "
Match 1251: " she said.  "
Match 1252: " he replied.  "
Match 1253: " she corrected herself scrupulously. her tone of consideration touched him, and he walked on in silence for a space.  "
Match 1254: " he exclaimed impulsively, and drew her arm through his. she withdrew it directly.  "
Match 1255: " she said.  the harshness, which henry had noticed, was again unmistakable in her manner. william flinched and was silent. such severity, accompanied by something indescribably cold and impersonal in her manner, had constantly been meted out to him during the last few days, always in the company of others. he had recouped himself by some ridiculous display of vanity which, as he knew, put him still more at her mercy. now that he was alone with her there was no stimulus from outside to draw his attention from his injury. by a considerable effort of self-control he forced himself to remain silent, and to make himself distinguish what part of his pain was due to vanity, what part to the certainty that no woman really loving him could speak thus.  "
Match 1256: " he thought to himself. it was clear that she had been a very desirable and distinguished figure, the mistress of her little section of the world; but more than that, she was the person of all others who seemed to him the arbitress of life, the woman whose judgment was naturally right and steady, as his had never been in spite of all his culture. and then he could not see her come into a room without a sense of the flowing of robes, of the flowering of blossoms, of the purple waves of the sea, of all things that are lovely and mutable on the surface but still and passionate in their heart.  "
Match 1257: " he thought. "
Match 1258: " he thought, "
Match 1259: " he was terribly tempted here to break the silence by asking katharine in what respects he could change himself to suit her; but he sought consolation instead by running over the list of his gifts and acquirements, his knowledge of greek and latin, his knowledge of art and literature, his skill in the management of meters, and his ancient west-country blood. but the feeling that underlay all these feelings and puzzled him profoundly and kept him silent was the certainty that he loved katharine as sincerely as he had it in him to love any one. and yet she could speak to him like that! in a sort of bewilderment he lost all desire to speak, and would quite readily have taken up some different topic of conversation if katharine had started one. this, however, she did not do.  he glanced at her, in case her expression might help him to understand her behavior. as usual, she had quickened her pace unconsciously, and was now walking a little in front of him; but he could gain little information from her eyes, which looked steadily at the brown heather, or from the lines drawn seriously upon her forehead. thus to lose touch with her, for he had no idea what she was thinking, was so unpleasant to him that he began to talk about his grievances again, without, however, much conviction in his voice.  "
Match 1260: "  "
Match 1261: " she burst out, as if he had interrupted some absorbing train of thought, "

"
Match 1279: " rodney persisted. "
Match 1280: " he cried.  a sense of her own misbehavior, which she had succeeded in keeping from her by sharpening her consciousness of rodney's faults, now swept over her and almost overwhelmed her. what were his faults in comparison with the fact that he cared for her? what were her virtues in comparison with the fact that she did not care for him? in a flash the conviction that not to care is the uttermost sin of all stamped itself upon her inmost thought; and she felt herself branded for ever.  he had taken her arm, and held her hand firmly in his, nor had she the force to resist what now seemed to her his enormously superior strength. very well; she would submit, as her mother and her aunt and most women, perhaps, had submitted; and yet she knew that every second of such submission to his strength was a second of treachery to him.  "

Match 1282: "  as none of her words seemed to her at all adequate to represent what she felt, she repeated them, and emphasized them without realizing the effect that they might have upon a man who cared for her. she was completely taken aback by finding her arm suddenly dropped; then she saw his face most strangely contorted; was he laughing, it flashed across her? in another moment she saw that he was in tears. in her bewilderment at this apparition she stood aghast for a second. with a desperate sense that this horror must, at all costs, be stopped, she then put her arms about him, drew his head for a moment upon her shoulder, and led him on, murmuring words of consolation, until he heaved a great sigh. they held fast to each other; her tears, too, ran down her cheeks; and were both quite silent. noticing the difficulty with which he walked, and feeling the same extreme lassitude in her own limbs, she proposed that they should rest for a moment where the bracken was brown and shriveled beneath an oak-tree. he assented. once more he gave a great sigh, and wiped his eyes with a childlike unconsciousness, and began to speak without a trace of his previous anger. the idea came to her that they were like the children in the fairy tale who were lost in a wood, and with this in her mind she noticed the scattering of dead leaves all round them which had been blown by the wind into heaps, a foot or two deep, here and there.

Match 1296: "  katharine started with displeasure at the mention of ralph's name. the thought of the conversation in which her conduct had been made a subject for discussion with denham roused her anger; but, as she instantly felt, she had scarcely the right to grudge william any use of her name, seeing what her fault against him had been from first to last. and yet denham! she had a view of him as a judge. she figured him sternly weighing instances of her levity in this masculine court of inquiry into feminine morality and gruffly dismissing both her and her family with some half-sarcastic, half-tolerant phrase which sealed her doom, as far as he was concerned, for ever. having met him so lately, the sense of his character was strong in her. the thought was not a pleasant one for a proud woman, but she had yet to learn the art of subduing her expression. her eyes fixed upon the ground, her brows drawn together, gave william a very fair picture of the resentment that she was forcing herself to control. a certain degree of apprehension, occasionally culminating in a kind of fear, had always entered into his love for her, and had increased, rather to his surprise, in the greater intimacy of their engagement. beneath her steady, exemplary surface ran a vein of passion which seemed to him now perverse, now completely irrational, for it never took the normal channel of glorification of him and his doings; and, indeed, he almost preferred the steady good sense, which had always marked their relationship, to a more romantic bond. but passion she had, he could not deny it, and hitherto he had tried to see it employed in his thoughts upon the lives of the children who were to be born to them.  "
Match 1297: " he thought; but seeing her sitting there, gloomy and silent, he began to have his doubts on this point. "
Match 1298: " he thought to himself. "
Match 1299: " and he became suddenly aware of their situation, sitting upon the ground, among the dead leaves, not fifty yards from the main road, so that it was quite possible for some one passing to see and recognize them. he brushed off his face any trace that might remain of that unseemly exhibition of emotion. but he was more troubled by katharine's appearance, as she sat rapt in thought upon the ground, than by his own; there was something improper to him in her self-forgetfulness. a man naturally alive to the conventions of society, he was strictly conventional where women were concerned, and especially if the women happened to be in any way connected with him. he noticed with distress the long strand of dark hair touching her shoulder and two or three dead beech-leaves attached to her dress; but to recall her mind in their present circumstances to a sense of these details was impossible. she sat there, seeming unconscious of everything. he suspected that in her silence she was reproaching herself; but he wished that she would think of her hair and of the dead beech-leaves, which were of more immediate importance to him than anything else. indeed, these trifles drew his attention strangely from his own doubtful and uneasy state of mind; for relief, mixing itself with pain, stirred up a most curious hurry and tumult in his breast, almost concealing his first sharp sense of bleak and overwhelming disappointment. in order to relieve this restlessness and close a distressingly ill-ordered scene, he rose abruptly and helped katharine to her feet. she smiled a little at the minute care with which he tidied her and yet, when he brushed the dead leaves from his own coat, she flinched, seeing in that action the gesture of a lonely man.  "
Match 1300: " she said, "
Match 1301: "    chapter xix  the afternoon was already growing dark when the two other wayfarers, mary and ralph denham, came out on the high road beyond the outskirts of lincoln. the high road, as they both felt, was better suited to this return journey than the open country, and for the first mile or so of the way they spoke little. in his own mind ralph was following the passage of the otway carriage over the heath; he then went back to the five or ten minutes that he had spent with katharine, and examined each word with the care that a scholar displays upon the irregularities of an ancient text. he was determined that the glow, the romance, the atmosphere of this meeting should not paint what he must in future regard as sober facts. on her side mary was silent, not because her thoughts took much handling, but because her mind seemed empty of thought as her heart of feeling. only ralph's presence, as she knew, preserved this numbness, for she could foresee a time of loneliness when many varieties of pain would beset her. at the present moment her effort was to preserve what she could of the wreck of her self-respect, for such she deemed that momentary glimpse of her love so involuntarily revealed to ralph. in the light of reason it did not much matter, perhaps, but it was her instinct to be careful of that vision of herself which keeps pace so evenly beside every one of us, and had been damaged by her confession. the gray night coming down over the country was kind to her; and she thought that one of these days she would find comfort in sitting upon the earth, alone, beneath a tree. looking through the darkness, she marked the swelling ground and the tree. ralph made her start by saying abruptly;  "
Match 1302: " he spoke firmly, waited for no answer, and took her arm in his. "
Match 1303: " he went on. "
Match 1304: "  she said nothing, but this did not seem to strike him.  "
Match 1305: " here he paused, and seemed to be in no hurry for an answer; he seemed, indeed, to be continuing his own thoughts.  "
Match 1306: " mary said at last. the casual and rather hurried way in which she spoke, together with the fact that she was saying the exact opposite of what he expected her to say, baffled him so much that he instinctively loosened his clasp upon her arm and she withdrew it quietly.  "
Match 1307: " he asked.  "
Match 1308: " she replied.  "
Match 1309: "  she made no answer.  "
Match 1310: " he said, with a curious laugh, "
Match 1311: " they walked for a minute or two in silence, and suddenly he turned to her, looked at her, and exclaimed: "
Match 1312: "  "
Match 1313: " she replied, turning her head away from him. "
Match 1314: "  the voice in which she stated this was so evidently the voice of one in some extremity of anguish that ralph had no course but to obey her. and as soon as the tone of her voice had died out, and the surprise faded from his mind, he found himself believing that she had spoken the truth, for he had but little vanity, and soon her refusal seemed a natural thing to him. he slipped through all the grades of despondency until he reached a bottom of absolute gloom. failure seemed to mark the whole of his life; he had failed with katharine, and now he had failed with mary. up at once sprang the thought of katharine, and with it a sense of exulting freedom, but this he checked instantly. no good had ever come to him from katharine; his whole relationship with her had been made up of dreams; and as he thought of the little substance there had been in his dreams he began to lay the blame of the present catastrophe upon his dreams.  "
Match 1315: "  the tramp of their boots upon the dry road seemed to asseverate nothing, nothing, nothing. mary thought that this silence was the silence of relief; his depression she ascribed to the fact that he had seen katharine and parted from her, leaving her in the company of william rodney. she could not blame him for loving katharine, but that, when he loved another, he should ask her to marry him--that seemed to her the cruellest treachery. their old friendship and its firm base upon indestructible qualities of character crumbled, and her whole past seemed foolish, herself weak and credulous, and ralph merely the shell of an honest man. oh, the past--so much made up of ralph; and now, as she saw, made up of something strange and false and other than she had thought it. she tried to recapture a saying she had made to help herself that morning, as ralph paid the bill for luncheon; but she could see him paying the bill more vividly than she could remember the phrase. something about truth was in it; how to see the truth is our great chance in this world.  "
Match 1316: " ralph now began again, without abruptness, with diffidence rather, "
Match 1317: "  "
Match 1318: "  "
Match 1319: " he resumed; "
Match 1320: "  she was immensely tempted to give way to her natural trust in him, revived by the deep and now melancholy tones of his voice, and to tell him of her love, and of what had changed it. but although it seemed likely that she would soon control her anger with him, the certainty that he did not love her, confirmed by every word of his proposal, forbade any freedom of speech. to hear him speak and to feel herself unable to reply, or constrained in her replies, was so painful that she longed for the time when she should be alone. a more pliant woman would have taken this chance of an explanation, whatever risks attached to it; but to one of mary's firm and resolute temperament there was degradation in the idea of self-abandonment; let the waves of emotion rise ever so high, she could not shut her eyes to what she conceived to be the truth. her silence puzzled ralph. he searched his memory for words or deeds that might have made her think badly of him. in his present mood instances came but too quickly, and on top of them this culminating proof of his baseness--that he had asked her to marry him when his reasons for such a proposal were selfish and half-hearted.  "
Match 1321: " he said grimly. "
Match 1322: "  "
Match 1323: " she thought to herself, with a sudden rush of anguish which threatened disaster to her self-respect, "
Match 1324: "  "
Match 1325: " she said, with what firmness she could muster.  "
Match 1326: " he said. he added, "
Match 1327: "  she promised this, and they went on to talk calmly of things that had no reference to their feelings--a talk which, in its constraint, was infinitely sad to both of them.  one more reference was made to the state of things between them late that night, when elizabeth had gone to her room, and the two young men had stumbled off to bed in such a state of sleep that they hardly felt the floor beneath their feet after a day's shooting.  mary drew her chair a little nearer to the fire, for the logs were burning low, and at this time of night it was hardly worth while to replenish them. ralph was reading, but she had noticed for some time that his eyes instead of following the print were fixed rather above the page with an intensity of gloom that came to weigh upon her mind. she had not weakened in her resolve not to give way, for reflection had only made her more bitterly certain that, if she gave way, it would be to her own wish and not to his. but she had determined that there was no reason why he should suffer if her reticence were the cause of his suffering. therefore, although she found it painful, she spoke:  "
Match 1328: " she said. "
Match 1329: "  ralph's book slid down upon his knee and fell upon the floor. he rested his forehead on his hand and looked into the fire. he was trying to recall the exact words in which he had made his proposal to mary.  "
Match 1330: " he said at last.  she winced; but she respected him for saying what he did, for this, after all, was a fragment of the truth which she had vowed to live by.  "
Match 1331: " she said.  "
Match 1332: " he said. "
Match 1333: "  "
Match 1334: " she replied with anger. "
Match 1335: " she shifted her position, as if she were about to go. an instinctive desire to prevent her from leaving the room made ralph rise at this point and begin pacing up and down the nearly empty kitchen, checking his desire, each time he reached the door, to open it and step out into the garden. a moralist might have said that at this point his mind should have been full of self-reproach for the suffering he had caused. on the contrary, he was extremely angry, with the confused impotent anger of one who finds himself unreasonably but efficiently frustrated. he was trapped by the illogicality of human life. the obstacles in the way of his desire seemed to him purely artificial, and yet he could see no way of removing them. mary's words, the tone of her voice even, angered him, for she would not help him. she was part of the insanely jumbled muddle of a world which impedes the sensible life. he would have liked to slam the door or break the hind legs of a chair, for the obstacles had taken some such curiously substantial shape in his mind.  "
Match 1336: " he said, stopping in his march and confronting mary at a distance of a few feet.  "
Match 1337: " he continued, as she did not speak. "
Match 1338: "  she saw herself in the suffrage office, delivering judgment, meting out right and wrong, and there seemed to her to be some justice in the charge, although it did not affect her main position.  "
Match 1339: " she said slowly. "
Match 1340: "  it was true that she had promised that much already, and it was difficult for him to say what more it was that he wanted--some intimacy, some help against the ghost of katharine, perhaps, something that he knew he had no right to ask; and yet, as he sank into his chair and looked once more at the dying fire it seemed to him that he had been defeated, not so much by mary as by life itself. he felt himself thrown back to the beginning of life again, where everything has yet to be won; but in extreme youth one has an ignorant hope. he was no longer certain that he would triumph.    chapter xx  happily for mary datchet she returned to the office to find that by some obscure parliamentary maneuver the vote had once more slipped beyond the attainment of women. mrs. seal was in a condition bordering upon frenzy. the duplicity of ministers, the treachery of mankind, the insult to womanhood, the setback to civilization, the ruin of her life's work, the feelings of her father's daughter--all these topics were discussed in turn, and the office was littered with newspaper cuttings branded with the blue, if ambiguous, marks of her displeasure. she confessed herself at fault in her estimate of human nature.  "
Match 1341: " she said, waving her hand towards the window, and indicating the foot-passengers and omnibuses then passing down the far side of russell square, "
Match 1342: " she continued, taking heart from her sight of the traffic, "
Match 1343: " she shook her head and implied that she would give them one more chance, and if they didn't take advantage of that she couldn't answer for the consequences.  mr. clacton's attitude was more philosophical and better supported by statistics. he came into the room after mrs. seal's outburst and pointed out, with historical illustrations, that such reverses had happened in every political campaign of any importance. if anything, his spirits were improved by the disaster. the enemy, he said, had taken the offensive; and it was now up to the society to outwit the enemy. he gave mary to understand that he had taken the measure of their cunning, and had already bent his mind to the task which, so far as she could make out, depended solely upon him. it depended, so she came to think, when invited into his room for a private conference, upon a systematic revision of the card-index, upon the issue of certain new lemon-colored leaflets, in which the facts were marshaled once more in a very striking way, and upon a large scale map of england dotted with little pins tufted with differently colored plumes of hair according to their geographical position. each district, under the new system, had its flag, its bottle of ink, its sheaf of documents tabulated and filed for reference in a drawer, so that by looking under m or s, as the case might be, you had all the facts with respect to the suffrage organizations of that county at your fingers' ends. this would require a great deal of work, of course.  "
Match 1344: " he said; and taking pleasure in his image, he continued it. "
Match 1345: " the system, of course, was only roughly sketched so far--jotted down, in fact, during the christmas holidays.  "
Match 1346: " said mary dutifully, but her tone was flat and tired.  "
Match 1347: " said mr. clacton, with a spark of satisfaction in his eye.  he wished particularly to have her opinion of the lemon-colored leaflet. according to his plan, it was to be distributed in immense quantities immediately, in order to stimulate and generate, "
Match 1348: " he repeated, "
Match 1349: "  "
Match 1350: " he said. "
Match 1351: "  he handed her a great bundle of newspaper cuttings, and, begging her to give him her views upon the yellow leaflet before lunch-time, he turned with alacrity to his different sheets of paper and his different bottles of ink.  mary shut the door, laid the documents upon her table, and sank her head on her hands. her brain was curiously empty of any thought. she listened, as if, perhaps, by listening she would become merged again in the atmosphere of the office. from the next room came the rapid spasmodic sounds of mrs. seal's erratic typewriting; she, doubtless, was already hard at work helping the people of england, as mr. clacton put it, to think rightly; "
Match 1352: " those were his words. she was striking a blow against the enemy, no doubt, who didn't let the grass grow beneath their feet. mr. clacton's words repeated themselves accurately in her brain. she pushed the papers wearily over to the farther side of the table. it was no use, though; something or other had happened to her brain--a change of focus so that near things were indistinct again. the same thing had happened to her once before, she remembered, after she had met ralph in the gardens of lincoln's inn fields; she had spent the whole of a committee meeting in thinking about sparrows and colors, until, almost at the end of the meeting, her old convictions had all come back to her. but they had only come back, she thought with scorn at her feebleness, because she wanted to use them to fight against ralph. they weren't, rightly speaking, convictions at all. she could not see the world divided into separate compartments of good people and bad people, any more than she could believe so implicitly in the rightness of her own thought as to wish to bring the population of the british isles into agreement with it. she looked at the lemon-colored leaflet, and thought almost enviously of the faith which could find comfort in the issue of such documents; for herself she would be content to remain silent for ever if a share of personal happiness were granted her. she read mr. clacton's statement with a curious division of judgment, noting its weak and pompous verbosity on the one hand, and, at the same time, feeling that faith, faith in an illusion, perhaps, but, at any rate, faith in something, was of all gifts the most to be envied. an illusion it was, no doubt. she looked curiously round her at the furniture of the office, at the machinery in which she had taken so much pride, and marveled to think that once the copying-presses, the card-index, the files of documents, had all been shrouded, wrapped in some mist which gave them a unity and a general dignity and purpose independently of their separate significance. the ugly cumbersomeness of the furniture alone impressed her now. her attitude had become very lax and despondent when the typewriter stopped in the next room. mary immediately drew up to the table, laid hands on an unopened envelope, and adopted an expression which might hide her state of mind from mrs. seal. some instinct of decency required that she should not allow mrs. seal to see her face. shading her eyes with her fingers, she watched mrs. seal pull out one drawer after another in her search for some envelope or leaflet. she was tempted to drop her fingers and exclaim:  "
Match 1353: " she said nothing of the kind, however, and the presence of industry which she preserved so long as mrs. seal was in the room served to set her brain in motion, so that she dispatched her morning's work much as usual. at one o'clock she was surprised to find how efficiently she had dealt with the morning. as she put her hat on she determined to lunch at a shop in the strand, so as to set that other piece of mechanism, her body, into action. with a brain working and a body working one could keep step with the crowd and never be found out for the hollow machine, lacking the essential thing, that one was conscious of being.  she considered her case as she walked down the charing cross road. she put to herself a series of questions. would she mind, for example, if the wheels of that motor-omnibus passed over her and crushed her to death? no, not in the least; or an adventure with that disagreeable-looking man hanging about the entrance of the tube station? no; she could not conceive fear or excitement. did suffering in any form appall her? no, suffering was neither good nor bad. and this essential thing? in the eyes of every single person she detected a flame; as if a spark in the brain ignited spontaneously at contact with the things they met and drove them on. the young women looking into the milliners' windows had that look in their eyes; and elderly men turning over books in the second-hand book-shops, and eagerly waiting to hear what the price was--the very lowest price--they had it, too. but she cared nothing at all for clothes or for money either. books she shrank from, for they were connected too closely with ralph. she kept on her way resolutely through the crowd of people, among whom she was so much of an alien, feeling them cleave and give way before her.  strange thoughts are bred in passing through crowded streets should the passenger, by chance, have no exact destination in front of him, much as the mind shapes all kinds of forms, solutions, images when listening inattentively to music. from an acute consciousness of herself as an individual, mary passed to a conception of the scheme of things in which, as a human being, she must have her share. she half held a vision; the vision shaped and dwindled. she wished she had a pencil and a piece of paper to help her to give a form to this conception which composed itself as she walked down the charing cross road. but if she talked to any one, the conception might escape her. her vision seemed to lay out the lines of her life until death in a way which satisfied her sense of harmony. it only needed a persistent effort of thought, stimulated in this strange way by the crowd and the noise, to climb the crest of existence and see it all laid out once and for ever. already her suffering as an individual was left behind her. of this process, which was to her so full of effort, which comprised infinitely swift and full passages of thought, leading from one crest to another, as she shaped her conception of life in this world, only two articulate words escaped her, muttered beneath her breath--"
Match 1354: "  she sat down on a seat opposite the statue of one of london's heroes upon the embankment, and spoke the words aloud. to her they represented the rare flower or splinter of rock brought down by a climber in proof that he has stood for a moment, at least, upon the highest peak of the mountain. she had been up there and seen the world spread to the horizon. it was now necessary to alter her course to some extent, according to her new resolve. her post should be in one of those exposed and desolate stations which are shunned naturally by happy people. she arranged the details of the new plan in her mind, not without a grim satisfaction.  "
Match 1355: " she said to herself, rising from her seat, "
Match 1356: "  where was he to be placed in the new scale of life? her exalted mood seemed to make it safe to handle the question. but she was dismayed to find how quickly her passions leapt forward the moment she sanctioned this line of thought. now she was identified with him and rethought his thoughts with complete self-surrender; now, with a sudden cleavage of spirit, she turned upon him and denounced him for his cruelty.  "
Match 1357: " she said aloud; chose the moment to cross the road with circumspection, and ten minutes later lunched in the strand, cutting her meat firmly into small pieces, but giving her fellow-diners no further cause to judge her eccentric. her soliloquy crystallized itself into little fragmentary phrases emerging suddenly from the turbulence of her thought, particularly when she had to exert herself in any way, either to move, to count money, or to choose a turning. "
Match 1358: "--those, perhaps, were the most articulate of her utterances, for no one could have made head or tail of the queer gibberish murmured in front of the statue of francis, duke of bedford, save that the name of ralph occurred frequently in very strange connections, as if, having spoken it, she wished, superstitiously, to cancel it by adding some other word that robbed the sentence with his name in it of any meaning.  those champions of the cause of women, mr. clacton and mrs. seal, did not perceive anything strange in mary's behavior, save that she was almost half an hour later than usual in coming back to the office. happily, their own affairs kept them busy, and she was free from their inspection. if they had surprised her they would have found her lost, apparently, in admiration of the large hotel across the square, for, after writing a few words, her pen rested upon the paper, and her mind pursued its own journey among the sun-blazoned windows and the drifts of purplish smoke which formed her view. and, indeed, this background was by no means out of keeping with her thoughts. she saw to the remote spaces behind the strife of the foreground, enabled now to gaze there, since she had renounced her own demands, privileged to see the larger view, to share the vast desires and sufferings of the mass of mankind. she had been too lately and too roughly mastered by facts to take an easy pleasure in the relief of renunciation; such satisfaction as she felt came only from the discovery that, having renounced everything that made life happy, easy, splendid, individual, there remained a hard reality, unimpaired by one's personal adventures, remote as the stars, unquenchable as they are.  while mary datchet was undergoing this curious transformation from the particular to the universal, mrs. seal remembered her duties with regard to the kettle and the gas-fire. she was a little surprised to find that mary had drawn her chair to the window, and, having lit the gas, she raised herself from a stooping posture and looked at her. the most obvious reason for such an attitude in a secretary was some kind of indisposition. but mary, rousing herself with an effort, denied that she was indisposed.  "
Match 1359: " she added, with a glance at her table. "
Match 1360: "  the words were meant to be taken lightly, but something in the tone of them roused a jealous fear which was always dormant in mrs. seal's breast. she was terribly afraid that one of these days mary, the young woman who typified so many rather sentimental and enthusiastic ideas, who had some sort of visionary existence in white with a sheaf of lilies in her hand, would announce, in a jaunty way, that she was about to be married.  "
Match 1361: " she said.  "
Match 1362: " said mary--a remark which could be taken as a generalization.  mrs. seal got the teacups out of the cupboard and set them on the table.  "
Match 1363: " she asked, pronouncing the words with nervous speed.  "
Match 1364: " mary asked, not very steadily. "
Match 1365: "  mrs. seal emitted a most peculiar chuckle. she seemed for one moment to acknowledge the terrible side of life which is concerned with the emotions, the private lives, of the sexes, and then to sheer off from it with all possible speed into the shades of her own shivering virginity. she was made so uncomfortable by the turn the conversation had taken, that she plunged her head into the cupboard, and endeavored to abstract some very obscure piece of china.  "
Match 1366: " she said, withdrawing her head, displaying cheeks more than usually crimson, and placing a jam-pot emphatically upon the table. but, for the moment, she was unable to launch herself upon one of those enthusiastic, but inconsequent, tirades upon liberty, democracy, the rights of the people, and the iniquities of the government, in which she delighted. some memory from her own past or from the past of her sex rose to her mind and kept her abashed. she glanced furtively at mary, who still sat by the window with her arm upon the sill. she noticed how young she was and full of the promise of womanhood. the sight made her so uneasy that she fidgeted the cups upon their saucers.  "
Match 1367: " said mary, as if concluding some passage of thought.  mrs. seal brightened at once. she lamented her lack of scientific training, and her deficiency in the processes of logic, but she set her mind to work at once to make the prospects of the cause appear as alluring and important as she could. she delivered herself of an harangue in which she asked a great many rhetorical questions and answered them with a little bang of one fist upon another.  "
Match 1368: "--she glanced fiercely at the window--"
Match 1369: " she continued, gesticulating with the kettle and the teapot. owing to these encumbrances, perhaps, she lost the thread of her discourse, and concluded, rather wistfully, "
Match 1370: " she referred to a matter that was a perpetual source of bewilderment to her--the extraordinary incapacity of the human race, in a world where the good is so unmistakably divided from the bad, of distinguishing one from the other, and embodying what ought to be done in a few large, simple acts of parliament, which would, in a very short time, completely change the lot of humanity.  "
Match 1371: " she said, "
Match 1372: " she reflected, "
Match 1373: "  doing homage to the phrase, she repeated it once more, and caught the ear of mr. clacton, as he issued from his room; and he repeated it a third time, giving it, as he was in the habit of doing with mrs. seal's phrases, a dryly humorous intonation. he was well pleased with the world, however, and he remarked, in a flattering manner, that he would like to see that phrase in large letters at the head of a leaflet.  "
Match 1374: " he added in his magisterial way to check the unbalanced enthusiasm of the women. "
Match 1375: " he continued, taking his place at the table and turning to mary as usual when about to deliver his more profound cogitations, "
Match 1376: " he said, sharpening the phrase to a satisfactory degree of literary precision.  his eyes rested, with something of the vanity of an author, upon the yellow leaflet which mary held in her hand. she rose, took her seat at the head of the table, poured out tea for her colleagues, and gave her opinion upon the leaflet. so she had poured out tea, so she had criticized mr. clacton's leaflets a hundred times already; but now it seemed to her that she was doing it in a different spirit; she had enlisted in the army, and was a volunteer no longer. she had renounced something and was now--how could she express it?--not quite "
Match 1377: " for life. she had always known that mr. clacton and mrs. seal were not in the running, and across the gulf that separated them she had seen them in the guise of shadow people, flitting in and out of the ranks of the living--eccentrics, undeveloped human beings, from whose substance some essential part had been cut away. all this had never struck her so clearly as it did this afternoon, when she felt that her lot was cast with them for ever. one view of the world plunged in darkness, so a more volatile temperament might have argued after a season of despair, let the world turn again and show another, more splendid, perhaps. no, mary thought, with unflinching loyalty to what appeared to her to be the true view, having lost what is best, i do not mean to pretend that any other view does instead. whatever happens, i mean to have no presences in my life. her very words had a sort of distinctness which is sometimes produced by sharp, bodily pain. to mrs. seal's secret jubilation the rule which forbade discussion of shop at tea-time was overlooked. mary and mr. clacton argued with a cogency and a ferocity which made the little woman feel that something very important--she hardly knew what--was taking place. she became much excited; one crucifix became entangled with another, and she dug a considerable hole in the table with the point of her pencil in order to emphasize the most striking heads of the discourse; and how any combination of cabinet ministers could resist such discourse she really did not know.  she could hardly bring herself to remember her own private instrument of justice--the typewriter. the telephone-bell rang, and as she hurried off to answer a voice which always seemed a proof of importance by itself, she felt that it was at this exact spot on the surface of the globe that all the subterranean wires of thought and progress came together. when she returned, with a message from the printer, she found that mary was putting on her hat firmly; there was something imperious and dominating in her attitude altogether.  "
Match 1378: " she said, "
Match 1379: "  "
Match 1380: " said mrs. seal, pausing with her hand on the papers, as the door shut behind mary. mr. clacton himself had been vaguely impressed by something in mary's behavior towards him. he envisaged a time even when it would become necessary to tell her that there could not be two masters in one office--but she was certainly able, very able, and in touch with a group of very clever young men. no doubt they had suggested to her some of her new ideas.  he signified his assent to mrs. seal's remark, but observed, with a glance at the clock, which showed only half an hour past five:  "
Match 1381: " so saying he returned to his room, and mrs. seal, after a moment's hesitation, hurried back to her labors.    chapter xxi  mary walked to the nearest station and reached home in an incredibly short space of time, just so much, indeed, as was needed for the intelligent understanding of the news of the world as the "
Match 1382: " reported it. within a few minutes of opening her door, she was in trim for a hard evening's work. she unlocked a drawer and took out a manuscript, which consisted of a very few pages, entitled, in a forcible hand, "
Match 1383: " the aspects dwindled out in a cries-cross of blotted lines in the very middle of a sentence, and suggested that the author had been interrupted, or convinced of the futility of proceeding, with her pen in the air.... oh, yes, ralph had come in at that point. she scored that sheet very effectively, and, choosing a fresh one, began at a great rate with a generalization upon the structure of human society, which was a good deal bolder than her custom. ralph had told her once that she couldn't write english, which accounted for those frequent blots and insertions; but she put all that behind her, and drove ahead with such words as came her way, until she had accomplished half a page of generalization and might legitimately draw breath. directly her hand stopped her brain stopped too, and she began to listen. a paper-boy shouted down the street; an omnibus ceased and lurched on again with the heave of duty once more shouldered; the dullness of the sounds suggested that a fog had risen since her return, if, indeed, a fog has power to deaden sound, of which fact, she could not be sure at the present moment. it was the sort of fact ralph denham knew. at any rate, it was no concern of hers, and she was about to dip a pen when her ear was caught by the sound of a step upon the stone staircase. she followed it past mr. chippen's chambers; past mr. gibson's; past mr. turner's; after which it became her sound. a postman, a washerwoman, a circular, a bill--she presented herself with each of these perfectly natural possibilities; but, to her surprise, her mind rejected each one of them impatiently, even apprehensively. the step became slow, as it was apt to do at the end of the steep climb, and mary, listening for the regular sound, was filled with an intolerable nervousness. leaning against the table, she felt the knock of her heart push her body perceptibly backwards and forwards--a state of nerves astonishing and reprehensible in a stable woman. grotesque fancies took shape. alone, at the top of the house, an unknown person approaching nearer and nearer--how could she escape? there was no way of escape. she did not even know whether that oblong mark on the ceiling was a trap-door to the roof or not. and if she got on to the roof--well, there was a drop of sixty feet or so on to the pavement. but she sat perfectly still, and when the knock sounded, she got up directly and opened the door without hesitation. she saw a tall figure outside, with something ominous to her eyes in the look of it.  "
Match 1384: " she said, not recognizing the face in the fitful light of the staircase.  "
Match 1385: "  mary's self-possession returned almost excessively, and her welcome was decidedly cold, as if she must recoup herself for this ridiculous waste of emotion. she moved her green-shaded lamp to another table, and covered "
Match 1386: " with a sheet of blotting-paper.  "
Match 1387: " she thought bitterly, connecting katharine and ralph in a conspiracy to take from her even this hour of solitary study, even this poor little defence against the world. and, as she smoothed down the sheet of blotting-paper over the manuscript, she braced herself to resist katharine, whose presence struck her, not merely by its force, as usual, but as something in the nature of a menace.  "
Match 1388: " said katharine, with hesitation, perceiving that she was not welcome.  "
Match 1389: " mary replied, drawing forward the best of the chairs and poking the fire.  "
Match 1390: " said katharine, in a tone which gave the impression that she was thinking of something else, as was, indeed, the case.  she had been paying calls with her mother, and in between the calls mrs. hilbery had rushed into shops and bought pillow-cases and blotting-books on no perceptible method for the furnishing of katharine's house. katharine had a sense of impedimenta accumulating on all sides of her. she had left her at length, and had come on to keep an engagement to dine with rodney at his rooms. but she did not mean to get to him before seven o'clock, and so had plenty of time to walk all the way from bond street to the temple if she wished it. the flow of faces streaming on either side of her had hypnotized her into a mood of profound despondency, to which her expectation of an evening alone with rodney contributed. they were very good friends again, better friends, they both said, than ever before. so far as she was concerned this was true. there were many more things in him than she had guessed until emotion brought them forth--strength, affection, sympathy. and she thought of them and looked at the faces passing, and thought how much alike they were, and how distant, nobody feeling anything as she felt nothing, and distance, she thought, lay inevitably between the closest, and their intimacy was the worst presence of all. for, "
Match 1391: " she thought, looking into a tobacconist's window, "
Match 1392: "  she looked desperately at the smooth-bowled pipes, and wondered--should she walk on by the strand or by the embankment? it was not a simple question, for it concerned not different streets so much as different streams of thought. if she went by the strand she would force herself to think out the problem of the future, or some mathematical problem; if she went by the river she would certainly begin to think about things that didn't exist--the forest, the ocean beach, the leafy solitudes, the magnanimous hero. no, no, no! a thousand times no!--it wouldn't do; there was something repulsive in such thoughts at present; she must take something else; she was out of that mood at present. and then she thought of mary; the thought gave her confidence, even pleasure of a sad sort, as if the triumph of ralph and mary proved that the fault of her failure lay with herself and not with life. an indistinct idea that the sight of mary might be of help, combined with her natural trust in her, suggested a visit; for, surely, her liking was of a kind that implied liking upon mary's side also. after a moment's hesitation she decided, although she seldom acted upon impulse, to act upon this one, and turned down a side street and found mary's door. but her reception was not encouraging; clearly mary didn't want to see her, had no help to impart, and the half-formed desire to confide in her was quenched immediately. she was slightly amused at her own delusion, looked rather absent-minded, and swung her gloves to and fro, as if doling out the few minutes accurately before she could say good-by.  those few minutes might very well be spent in asking for information as to the exact position of the suffrage bill, or in expounding her own very sensible view of the situation. but there was a tone in her voice, or a shade in her opinions, or a swing of her gloves which served to irritate mary datchet, whose manner became increasingly direct, abrupt, and even antagonistic. she became conscious of a wish to make katharine realize the importance of this work, which she discussed so coolly, as though she, too, had sacrificed what mary herself had sacrificed. the swinging of the gloves ceased, and katharine, after ten minutes, began to make movements preliminary to departure. at the sight of this, mary was aware--she was abnormally aware of things to-night--of another very strong desire; katharine was not to be allowed to go, to disappear into the free, happy world of irresponsible individuals. she must be made to realize--to feel.  "
Match 1393: " she said, as if katharine had challenged her explicitly, "
Match 1394: "  "
Match 1395: "  mary pressed her lips, and smiled ironically; she had katharine at her mercy; she could, if she liked, discharge upon her head wagon-loads of revolting proof of the state of things ignored by the casual, the amateur, the looker-on, the cynical observer of life at a distance. and yet she hesitated. as usual, when she found herself in talk with katharine, she began to feel rapid alternations of opinion about her, arrows of sensation striking strangely through the envelope of personality, which shelters us so conveniently from our fellows. what an egoist, how aloof she was! and yet, not in her words, perhaps, but in her voice, in her face, in her attitude, there were signs of a soft brooding spirit, of a sensibility unblunted and profound, playing over her thoughts and deeds, and investing her manner with an habitual gentleness. the arguments and phrases of mr. clacton fell flat against such armor.  "
Match 1396: " she said inconsequently, and with an accent of condescension. she was not going to make katharine understand in a second, as she would, all she herself had learnt at the cost of such pain. no. katharine was to be happy; katharine was to be ignorant; mary was to keep this knowledge of the impersonal life for herself. the thought of her morning's renunciation stung her conscience, and she tried to expand once more into that impersonal condition which was so lofty and so painless. she must check this desire to be an individual again, whose wishes were in conflict with those of other people. she repented of her bitterness.  katharine now renewed her signs of leave-taking; she had drawn on one of her gloves, and looked about her as if in search of some trivial saying to end with. wasn't there some picture, or clock, or chest of drawers which might be singled out for notice? something peaceable and friendly to end the uncomfortable interview? the green-shaded lamp burnt in the corner, and illumined books and pens and blotting-paper. the whole aspect of the place started another train of thought and struck her as enviably free; in such a room one could work--one could have a life of one's own.  "
Match 1397: " she observed. "
Match 1398: "--and engaged in this exalted way, which had no recognition or engagement-ring, she added in her own mind.  mary's lips parted slightly. she could not conceive in what respects katharine, who spoke sincerely, could envy her.  "
Match 1399: " she said.  "
Match 1400: " katharine observed vaguely.  "
Match 1401: "  katharine remained silent. she gazed into the fire quietly, and without a trace of self-consciousness. the hostility which she had divined in mary's tone had completely disappeared, and she forgot that she had been upon the point of going.  "
Match 1402: " she said at length. "
Match 1403: " she paused; she did not know how to express what she meant.  "
Match 1404: " she resumed, with a smile; "
Match 1405: " she spoke half-mockingly, asking her question, which she scarcely troubled to frame, not of mary, or of any one in particular.  but the words seemed to mary datchet shallow, supercilious, cold-blooded, and cynical all in one. all her natural instincts were roused in revolt against them.  "
Match 1406: " she said.  "
Match 1407: " katharine replied, looking at her as if now she were about, perhaps, to explain something very important.  mary could not help feeling the simplicity and good faith that lay behind katharine's words.  "
Match 1408: " she said.  "
Match 1409: " said katharine, almost sadly. she understood that mary was thinking of ralph, and she felt it impossible to press her to reveal more of this exalted condition; she could only respect the fact that, in some few cases, life arranged itself thus satisfactorily and pass on. she rose to her feet accordingly. but mary exclaimed, with unmistakable earnestness, that she must not go; that they met so seldom; that she wanted to talk to her so much.... katharine was surprised at the earnestness with which she spoke. it seemed to her that there could be no indiscretion in mentioning ralph by name.  seating herself "
Match 1410: " she said: "
Match 1411: "  "
Match 1412: " said mary briefly. the color at once came to her face.  "
Match 1413: " said katharine in her decided way.  "
Match 1414: "  "
Match 1415: "  mary bent low over the fire and stirred the coal between the bars with a poker. katharine's mention of ralph had roused within her an almost irresistible desire to explain to her the true state of the case between herself and ralph. she knew, from the tone of her voice, that in speaking of ralph she had no desire to probe mary's secrets, or to insinuate any of her own. moreover, she liked katharine; she trusted her; she felt a respect for her. the first step of confidence was comparatively simple; but a further confidence had revealed itself, as katharine spoke, which was not so simple, and yet it impressed itself upon her as a necessity; she must tell katharine what it was clear that she had no conception of--she must tell katharine that ralph was in love with her.  "
Match 1416: " she said hurriedly, seeking time against the pressure of her own conviction. "
Match 1417: "  katharine reflected that this was odd; perhaps, after all, she had misunderstood the position. she was in the habit of assuming, however, that she was rather unobservant of the finer shades of feeling, and she noted her present failure as another proof that she was a practical, abstract-minded person, better fitted to deal with figures than with the feelings of men and women. anyhow, william rodney would say so.  "
Match 1418: " she said.  "
Match 1419: " mary exclaimed, putting out her hand to stop her. directly katharine moved she felt, inarticulately and violently, that she could not bear to let her go. if katharine went, her only chance of speaking was lost; her only chance of saying something tremendously important was lost. half a dozen words were sufficient to wake katharine's attention, and put flight and further silence beyond her power. but although the words came to her lips, her throat closed upon them and drove them back. after all, she considered, why should she speak? because it is right, her instinct told her; right to expose oneself without reservations to other human beings. she flinched from the thought. it asked too much of one already stripped bare. something she must keep of her own. but if she did keep something of her own? immediately she figured an immured life, continuing for an immense period, the same feelings living for ever, neither dwindling nor changing within the ring of a thick stone wall. the imagination of this loneliness frightened her, and yet to speak--to lose her loneliness, for it had already become dear to her, was beyond her power.  her hand went down to the hem of katharine's skirt, and, fingering a line of fur, she bent her head as if to examine it.  "
Match 1420: " she said, "
Match 1421: " she continued, in the same tone, "
Match 1422: " her head remained bent, and her hand still rested upon the skirt.  "
Match 1423: " said katharine, and the only sign that mary's words had reached her was that she spoke with a little jerk.  "
Match 1424: " said mary, raising herself.  "
Match 1425: " said katharine; "
Match 1426: " she was, in truth, horribly uncomfortable, dismayed, indeed, disillusioned. she disliked the turn things had taken quite intensely. the indecency of it afflicted her. the suffering implied by the tone appalled her. she looked at mary furtively, with eyes that were full of apprehension. but if she had hoped to find that these words had been spoken without understanding of their meaning, she was at once disappointed. mary lay back in her chair, frowning slightly, and looking, katharine thought, as if she had lived fifteen years or so in the space of a few minutes.  "
Match 1427: " mary said, quietly and almost coldly. "
Match 1428: " she added. "
Match 1429: " here she paused. "
Match 1430: " she proceeded, rousing herself and speaking with greater energy, "
Match 1431: " the little forward shake of her head, which shook a lock of hair, together with her brighter color, gave her an appearance at once proud and defiant.  katharine thought to herself, "
Match 1432: " she hesitated, with a feeling that it was not for her to speak; and then said, in a low tone, "
Match 1433: "  "
Match 1434: " said mary; "
Match 1435: " she paused. "
Match 1436: "  katharine looked at her again, as if her first glance must have been deluded, for, surely, there must be some outward sign that mary was talking in an excited, or bewildered, or fantastic manner. no; she still frowned, as if she sought her way through the clauses of a difficult argument, but she still looked more like one who reasons than one who feels.  "
Match 1437: " said katharine, speaking reasonably, too. she had no need to verify the mistake by a glance at her own recollections, when the fact was so clearly stamped upon her mind that if ralph had any feeling towards her it was one of critical hostility. she did not give the matter another thought, and mary, now that she had stated the fact, did not seek to prove it, but tried to explain to herself, rather than to katharine, her motives in making the statement.  she had nerved herself to do what some large and imperious instinct demanded her doing; she had been swept on the breast of a wave beyond her reckoning.  "
Match 1438: " she said, "
Match 1439: "  she hesitated, and groped in her endeavor to make her feelings clear to herself.  "
Match 1440: "  "
Match 1441: " said katharine, with considerable indignation. in order to have produced such suffering in mary, it seemed to her that he must have behaved with extreme callousness. it seemed to her that he had discarded the friendship, when it suited his convenience to do so, with some falsely philosophical theory which made his conduct all the worse. she was going on to express herself thus, had not mary at once interrupted her.  "
Match 1442: " she said; "
Match 1443: "  her voice faltered into silence. it was borne in upon her how completely in running her risk she had lost her prize, lost it so entirely that she had no longer the right, in talking of ralph, to presume that her knowledge of him supplanted all other knowledge. she no longer completely possessed her love, since his share in it was doubtful; and now, to make things yet more bitter, her clear vision of the way to face life was rendered tremulous and uncertain, because another was witness of it. feeling her desire for the old unshared intimacy too great to be borne without tears, she rose, walked to the farther end of the room, held the curtains apart, and stood there mastered for a moment. the grief itself was not ignoble; the sting of it lay in the fact that she had been led to this act of treachery against herself. trapped, cheated, robbed, first by ralph and then by katharine, she seemed all dissolved in humiliation, and bereft of anything she could call her own. tears of weakness welled up and rolled down her cheeks. but tears, at least, she could control, and would this instant, and then, turning, she would face katharine, and retrieve what could be retrieved of the collapse of her courage.  she turned. katharine had not moved; she was leaning a little forward in her chair and looking into the fire. something in the attitude reminded mary of ralph. so he would sit, leaning forward, looking rather fixedly in front of him, while his mind went far away, exploring, speculating, until he broke off with his, "
Match 1444: "--and the silence, that had been so full of romance to her, gave way to the most delightful talk that she had ever known.  something unfamiliar in the pose of the silent figure, something still, solemn, significant about it, made her hold her breath. she paused. her thoughts were without bitterness. she was surprised by her own quiet and confidence. she came back silently, and sat once more by katharine's side. mary had no wish to speak. in the silence she seemed to have lost her isolation; she was at once the sufferer and the pitiful spectator of suffering; she was happier than she had ever been; she was more bereft; she was rejected, and she was immensely beloved. attempt to express these sensations was vain, and, moreover, she could not help believing that, without any words on her side, they were shared. thus for some time longer they sat silent, side by side, while mary fingered the fur on the skirt of the old dress.    chapter xxii  the fact that she would be late in keeping her engagement with william was not the only reason which sent katharine almost at racing speed along the strand in the direction of his rooms. punctuality might have been achieved by taking a cab, had she not wished the open air to fan into flame the glow kindled by mary's words. for among all the impressions of the evening's talk one was of the nature of a revelation and subdued the rest to insignificance. thus one looked; thus one spoke; such was love.  "
Match 1445: " katharine mused, trying to set the whole scene in motion. it was a scene to dwell on with so much wonder that not a grain of pity occurred to her; it was a flame blazing suddenly in the dark; by its light katharine perceived far too vividly for her comfort the mediocrity, indeed the entirely fictitious character of her own feelings so far as they pretended to correspond with mary's feelings. she made up her mind to act instantly upon the knowledge thus gained, and cast her mind in amazement back to the scene upon the heath, when she had yielded, heaven knows why, for reasons which seemed now imperceptible. so in broad daylight one might revisit the place where one has groped and turned and succumbed to utter bewilderment in a fog.  "
Match 1446: " she said to herself. "
Match 1447: " she went on saying, in time to her own footsteps, and completely forgot mary datchet.  william rodney, having come back earlier from the office than he expected, sat down to pick out the melodies in "
Match 1448: " upon the piano. katharine was late, but that was nothing new, and, as she had no particular liking for music, and he felt in the mood for it, perhaps it was as well. this defect in katharine was the more strange, william reflected, because, as a rule, the women of her family were unusually musical. her cousin, cassandra otway, for example, had a very fine taste in music, and he had charming recollections of her in a light fantastic attitude, playing the flute in the morning-room at stogdon house. he recalled with pleasure the amusing way in which her nose, long like all the otway noses, seemed to extend itself into the flute, as if she were some inimitably graceful species of musical mole. the little picture suggested very happily her melodious and whimsical temperament. the enthusiasms of a young girl of distinguished upbringing appealed to william, and suggested a thousand ways in which, with his training and accomplishments, he could be of service to her. she ought to be given the chance of hearing good music, as it is played by those who have inherited the great tradition. moreover, from one or two remarks let fall in the course of conversation, he thought it possible that she had what katharine professed to lack, a passionate, if untaught, appreciation of literature. he had lent her his play. meanwhile, as katharine was certain to be late, and "
Match 1449: " is nothing without a voice, he felt inclined to spend the time of waiting in writing a letter to cassandra, exhorting her to read pope in preference to dostoevsky, until her feeling for form was more highly developed. he set himself down to compose this piece of advice in a shape which was light and playful, and yet did no injury to a cause which he had near at heart, when he heard katharine upon the stairs. a moment later it was plain that he had been mistaken, it was not katharine; but he could not settle himself to his letter. his temper had changed from one of urbane contentment--indeed of delicious expansion--to one of uneasiness and expectation. the dinner was brought in, and had to be set by the fire to keep hot. it was now a quarter of an hour beyond the specified time. he bethought him of a piece of news which had depressed him in the earlier part of the day. owing to the illness of one of his fellow-clerks, it was likely that he would get no holiday until later in the year, which would mean the postponement of their marriage. but this possibility, after all, was not so disagreeable as the probability which forced itself upon him with every tick of the clock that katharine had completely forgotten her engagement. such things had happened less frequently since christmas, but what if they were going to begin to happen again? what if their marriage should turn out, as she had said, a farce? he acquitted her of any wish to hurt him wantonly, but there was something in her character which made it impossible for her to help hurting people. was she cold? was she self-absorbed? he tried to fit her with each of these descriptions, but he had to own that she puzzled him.  "
Match 1450: " he reflected, glancing at the letter to cassandra which he had begun and laid aside. what prevented him from finishing the letter which he had so much enjoyed beginning? the reason was that katharine might, at any moment, enter the room. the thought, implying his bondage to her, irritated him acutely. it occurred to him that he would leave the letter lying open for her to see, and he would take the opportunity of telling her that he had sent his play to cassandra for her to criticize. possibly, but not by any means certainly, this would annoy her--and as he reached the doubtful comfort of this conclusion, there was a knock on the door and katharine came in. they kissed each other coldly and she made no apology for being late. nevertheless, her mere presence moved him strangely; but he was determined that this should not weaken his resolution to make some kind of stand against her; to get at the truth about her. he let her make her own disposition of clothes and busied himself with the plates.  "
Match 1451: " he said directly they sat down to table; "
Match 1452: "  he rapped the words out with a certain degree of briskness. katharine started a little, as if the announcement disturbed her thoughts.  "
Match 1453: " she replied. "
Match 1454: "  he told her, in an off-hand way, how one of his fellow-clerks had broken down, and might have to be away for months, six months even, in which case they would have to think over their position. he said it in a way which struck her, at last, as oddly casual. she looked at him. there was no outward sign that he was annoyed with her. was she well dressed? she thought sufficiently so. perhaps she was late? she looked for a clock.  "
Match 1455: " she repeated thoughtfully.  "
Match 1456: " he continued. she had time to reflect that she gained something by all this, though it was too soon to determine what. but the light which had been burning with such intensity as she came along was suddenly overclouded, as much by his manner as by his news. she had been prepared to meet opposition, which is simple to encounter compared with--she did not know what it was that she had to encounter. the meal passed in quiet, well-controlled talk about indifferent things. music was not a subject about which she knew anything, but she liked him to tell her things; and could, she mused, as he talked, fancy the evenings of married life spent thus, over the fire; spent thus, or with a book, perhaps, for then she would have time to read her books, and to grasp firmly with every muscle of her unused mind what she longed to know. the atmosphere was very free. suddenly william broke off. she looked up apprehensively, brushing aside these thoughts with annoyance.  "
Match 1457: " he asked her. it was obvious again that william had some meaning or other to-night, or was in some mood. "
Match 1458: " he added.  "
Match 1459: " katharine replied.  "
Match 1460: " said william. "
Match 1461: "  katharine sank back in her chair, and rodney took the paper on his knees, and went on with his sentence. "
Match 1462: "; but he was far more conscious of katharine's eye upon him than of what he was saying about style. he knew that she was looking at him, but whether with irritation or indifference he could not guess.  in truth, she had fallen sufficiently into his trap to feel uncomfortably roused and disturbed and unable to proceed on the lines laid down for herself. this indifferent, if not hostile, attitude on william's part made it impossible to break off without animosity, largely and completely. infinitely preferable was mary's state, she thought, where there was a simple thing to do and one did it. in fact, she could not help supposing that some littleness of nature had a part in all the refinements, reserves, and subtleties of feeling for which her friends and family were so distinguished. for example, although she liked cassandra well enough, her fantastic method of life struck her as purely frivolous; now it was socialism, now it was silkworms, now it was music--which last she supposed was the cause of william's sudden interest in her. never before had william wasted the minutes of her presence in writing his letters. with a curious sense of light opening where all, hitherto, had been opaque, it dawned upon her that, after all, possibly, yes, probably, nay, certainly, the devotion which she had almost wearily taken for granted existed in a much slighter degree than she had suspected, or existed no longer. she looked at him attentively as if this discovery of hers must show traces in his face. never had she seen so much to respect in his appearance, so much that attracted her by its sensitiveness and intelligence, although she saw these qualities as if they were those one responds to, dumbly, in the face of a stranger. the head bent over the paper, thoughtful as usual, had now a composure which seemed somehow to place it at a distance, like a face seen talking to some one else behind glass.  he wrote on, without raising his eyes. she would have spoken, but could not bring herself to ask him for signs of affection which she had no right to claim. the conviction that he was thus strange to her filled her with despondency, and illustrated quite beyond doubt the infinite loneliness of human beings. she had never felt the truth of this so strongly before. she looked away into the fire; it seemed to her that even physically they were now scarcely within speaking distance; and spiritually there was certainly no human being with whom she could claim comradeship; no dream that satisfied her as she was used to be satisfied; nothing remained in whose reality she could believe, save those abstract ideas--figures, laws, stars, facts, which she could hardly hold to for lack of knowledge and a kind of shame.  when rodney owned to himself the folly of this prolonged silence, and the meanness of such devices, and looked up ready to seek some excuse for a good laugh, or opening for a confession, he was disconcerted by what he saw. katharine seemed equally oblivious of what was bad or of what was good in him. her expression suggested concentration upon something entirely remote from her surroundings. the carelessness of her attitude seemed to him rather masculine than feminine. his impulse to break up the constraint was chilled, and once more the exasperating sense of his own impotency returned to him. he could not help contrasting katharine with his vision of the engaging, whimsical cassandra; katharine undemonstrative, inconsiderate, silent, and yet so notable that he could never do without her good opinion.  she veered round upon him a moment later, as if, when her train of thought was ended, she became aware of his presence.  "
Match 1463: " she asked. he thought he heard faint amusement in her tone, but not a trace of jealousy.  "
Match 1464: " he said. "
Match 1465: "  "
Match 1466: " katharine remarked.  "
Match 1467: "  "
Match 1468: " said katharine indifferently. "
Match 1469: " so speaking, she went across to his bookshelves and began looking in a desultory way among his books. anything, she thought, was better than bickering or the strange silence which drove home to her the distance between them. as she pulled one book forward and then another she thought ironically of her own certainty not an hour ago; how it had vanished in a moment, how she was merely marking time as best she could, not knowing in the least where they stood, what they felt, or whether william loved her or not. more and more the condition of mary's mind seemed to her wonderful and enviable--if, indeed, it could be quite as she figured it--if, indeed, simplicity existed for any one of the daughters of women.  "
Match 1470: " she said, at last, taking out a volume at haphazard to settle this question at least. "
Match 1471: "  rodney took the book, held it in front of him, inserted one finger between the pages, but said nothing. his face wore a queer expression of deliberation, as if he were weighing one thing with another, and would not say anything until his mind were made up.  katharine, taking her chair beside him, noted his silence and looked at him with sudden apprehension. what she hoped or feared, she could not have said; a most irrational and indefensible desire for some assurance of his affection was, perhaps, uppermost in her mind. peevishness, complaints, exacting cross-examination she was used to, but this attitude of composed quiet, which seemed to come from the consciousness of power within, puzzled her. she did not know what was going to happen next.  at last william spoke.  "
Match 1472: " he said, in a voice of detached reflection. "
Match 1473: "  she looked at him and observed his judicial attitude as of one holding far aloof from emotion.  "
Match 1474: " he went on, without waiting for her to answer, "
Match 1475: "  "
Match 1476: "  "
Match 1477: " he continued, as if the question interested him in a detached way, "
Match 1478: "  it was, perhaps, the first time in all her knowledge of him that katharine had known william enter thus deliberately and without sign of emotion upon a statement of his own feelings. he was wont to discourage such intimate discussions by a little laugh or turn of the conversation, as much as to say that men, or men of the world, find such topics a little silly, or in doubtful taste. his obvious wish to explain something puzzled her, interested her, and neutralized the wound to her vanity. for some reason, too, she felt more at ease with him than usual; or her ease was more the ease of equality--she could not stop to think of that at the moment though. his remarks interested her too much for the light that they threw upon certain problems of her own.  "
Match 1479: " she mused.  "
Match 1480: "--he glanced in the direction of his books.  "
Match 1481: " she hazarded.  "
Match 1482: "  "
Match 1483: " she hesitated.  "
Match 1484: " he asked, letting his eyes rest upon her swiftly for a moment.  "
Match 1485: " she said, in the tone of one absorbed by the possibilities of some view just presented to them; "
Match 1486: " she added. she reviewed her daily task, the perpetual demands upon her for good sense, self-control, and accuracy in a house containing a romantic mother. ah, but her romance wasn't that romance. it was a desire, an echo, a sound; she could drape it in color, see it in form, hear it in music, but not in words; no, never in words. she sighed, teased by desires so incoherent, so incommunicable.  "
Match 1487: " william resumed, "
Match 1488: "  katharine agreed that it was curious--very; but even more curious to her was the fact that she was discussing the question with william. it revealed possibilities which opened a prospect of a new relationship altogether. somehow it seemed to her that he was helping her to understand what she had never understood; and in her gratitude she was conscious of a most sisterly desire to help him, too--sisterly, save for one pang, not quite to be subdued, that for him she was without romance.  "
Match 1489: " she said.  "
Match 1490: "  he asked the question formally, to protect himself from the sort of personality which he dreaded. the whole situation needed the most careful management lest it should degenerate into some degrading and disturbing exhibition such as the scene, which he could never think of without shame, upon the heath among the dead leaves. and yet each sentence brought him relief. he was coming to understand something or other about his own desires hitherto undefined by him, the source of his difficulty with katharine. the wish to hurt her, which had urged him to begin, had completely left him, and he felt that it was only katharine now who could help him to be sure. he must take his time. there were so many things that he could not say without the greatest difficulty--that name, for example, cassandra. nor could he move his eyes from a certain spot, a fiery glen surrounded by high mountains, in the heart of the coals. he waited in suspense for katharine to continue. she had said that he might be very happy with some one he loved in that way.  "
Match 1491: " she resumed. "
Match 1492: " she paused; she was aware that he was listening with the greatest intentness, and that his formality was merely the cover for an extreme anxiety of some sort. there was some person then--some woman--who could it be? cassandra? ah, possibly--  "
Match 1493: " she added, speaking in the most matter-of-fact tone she could command, "
Match 1494: "  "
Match 1495: " burst from william, with a nervous laugh, and a little spasm went through him as katharine noticed. it was cassandra then. automatically and dully she replied, "
Match 1496: "  she ceased, as if defining to herself this peculiar charm. after a moment's silence william jerked out:  "
Match 1497: "  "
Match 1498: "  "
Match 1499: " william muttered.  "
Match 1500: "  "
Match 1501: " william exclaimed, flinging himself back in his chair, and uprooting his eyes from the spot in the fire. "
Match 1502: "  he was covered with an extreme confusion.  he withdrew the finger that was still thrust between the pages of gulliver, opened the book, and ran his eye down the list of chapters, as though he were about to select the one most suitable for reading aloud. as katharine watched him, she was seized with preliminary symptoms of his own panic. at the same time she was convinced that, should he find the right page, take out his spectacles, clear his throat, and open his lips, a chance that would never come again in all their lives would be lost to them both.  "
Match 1503: " she said. "
Match 1504: "  the presence of wise literary speculation, as she calculated, restored william's confidence in his security, and he replaced the book in the bookcase, keeping his back turned to her as he did so, and taking advantage of this circumstance to summon his thoughts together.  but a second of introspection had the alarming result of showing him that his mind, when looked at from within, was no longer familiar ground. he felt, that is to say, what he had never consciously felt before; he was revealed to himself as other than he was wont to think him; he was afloat upon a sea of unknown and tumultuous possibilities. he paced once up and down the room, and then flung himself impetuously into the chair by katharine's side. he had never felt anything like this before; he put himself entirely into her hands; he cast off all responsibility. he very nearly exclaimed aloud:  "
Match 1505: "  her near presence, however, had a calming and reassuring effect upon his agitation, and he was conscious only of an implicit trust that, somehow, he was safe with her, that she would see him through, find out what it was that he wanted, and procure it for him.  "
Match 1506: " he said. "
Match 1507: "  "
Match 1508: " she said.  "
Match 1509: " he broke off; he did not tell her what had happened then. "
Match 1510: " he exclaimed.  "
Match 1511: " she said gently.  william bowed his head. after a moment's silence he murmured:  "
Match 1512: "  she sighed, involuntarily. she had been hoping all this time, with an intensity that increased second by second against the current of her words, that it would not in the end come to this. after a moment of surprising anguish, she summoned her courage to tell him how she wished only that she might help him, and had framed the first words of her speech when a knock, terrific and startling to people in their overwrought condition, sounded upon the door.  "
Match 1513: " he urged, half in a whisper.  "
Match 1514: " she replied, withdrawing with a little shiver, "
Match 1515: "    chapter xxiii  when ralph denham entered the room and saw katharine seated with her back to him, he was conscious of a change in the grade of the atmosphere such as a traveler meets with sometimes upon the roads, particularly after sunset, when, without warning, he runs from clammy chill to a hoard of unspent warmth in which the sweetness of hay and beanfield is cherished, as if the sun still shone although the moon is up. he hesitated; he shuddered; he walked elaborately to the window and laid aside his coat. he balanced his stick most carefully against the folds of the curtain. thus occupied with his own sensations and preparations, he had little time to observe what either of the other two was feeling. such symptoms of agitation as he might perceive (and they had left their tokens in brightness of eye and pallor of cheeks) seemed to him well befitting the actors in so great a drama as that of katharine hilbery's daily life. beauty and passion were the breath of her being, he thought.  she scarcely noticed his presence, or only as it forced her to adopt a manner of composure, which she was certainly far from feeling. william, however, was even more agitated than she was, and her first instalment of promised help took the form of some commonplace upon the age of the building or the architect's name, which gave him an excuse to fumble in a drawer for certain designs, which he laid upon the table between the three of them.  which of the three followed the designs most carefully it would be difficult to tell, but it is certain that not one of the three found for the moment anything to say. years of training in a drawing-room came at length to katharine's help, and she said something suitable, at the same moment withdrawing her hand from the table because she perceived that it trembled. william agreed effusively; denham corroborated him, speaking in rather high-pitched tones; they thrust aside the plans, and drew nearer to the fireplace.  "
Match 1516: " said denham.  ("
Match 1517: ") katharine thought, as she agreed aloud.  "
Match 1518: " rodney replied.  "
Match 1519: " the announcement seemed to convey very little to either of his hearers.  "
Match 1520: "  "
Match 1521: " denham remarked.  william showed such visible signs of floundering that katharine collected herself and asked:  "
Match 1522: "  in answering her, denham turned and looked at her. as their eyes met, she realized for the first time that she was talking to ralph denham, and she remembered, without recalling any details, that she had been speaking of him quite lately, and that she had reason to think ill of him. what mary had said she could not remember, but she felt that there was a mass of knowledge in her mind which she had not had time to examine--knowledge now lying on the far side of a gulf. but her agitation flashed the queerest lights upon her past. she must get through the matter in hand, and then think it out in quiet. she bent her mind to follow what ralph was saying. he was telling her that he had taken a cottage in norfolk, and she was saying that she knew, or did not know, that particular neighborhood. but after a moment's attention her mind flew to rodney, and she had an unusual, indeed unprecedented, sense that they were in touch and shared each other's thoughts. if only ralph were not there, she would at once give way to her desire to take william's hand, then to bend his head upon her shoulder, for this was what she wanted to do more than anything at the moment, unless, indeed, she wished more than anything to be alone--yes, that was what she wanted. she was sick to death of these discussions; she shivered at the effort to reveal her feelings. she had forgotten to answer. william was speaking now.  "
Match 1523: " she asked at random, striking into a conversation which she had only half heard, in such a way as to make both rodney and denham look at her with a little surprise. but directly she took up the conversation, it was william's turn to fall silent. he at once forgot to listen to what they were saying, although he interposed nervously at intervals, "
Match 1524: " as the minutes passed, ralph's presence became more and more intolerable to him, since there was so much that he must say to katharine; the moment he could not talk to her, terrible doubts, unanswerable questions accumulated, which he must lay before katharine, for she alone could help him now. unless he could see her alone, it would be impossible for him ever to sleep, or to know what he had said in a moment of madness, which was not altogether mad, or was it mad? he nodded his head, and said, nervously, "
Match 1525: " and looked at katharine, and thought how beautiful she looked; there was no one in the world that he admired more. there was an emotion in her face which lent it an expression he had never seen there. then, as he was turning over means by which he could speak to her alone, she rose, and he was taken by surprise, for he had counted on the fact that she would outstay denham. his only chance, then, of saying something to her in private, was to take her downstairs and walk with her to the street. while he hesitated, however, overcome with the difficulty of putting one simple thought into words when all his thoughts were scattered about, and all were too strong for utterance, he was struck silent by something that was still more unexpected. denham got up from his chair, looked at katharine, and said:  "
Match 1526: "  and before william could see any way of detaining him--or would it be better to detain katharine?--he had taken his hat, stick, and was holding the door open for katharine to pass out. the most that william could do was to stand at the head of the stairs and say good-night. he could not offer to go with them. he could not insist that she should stay. he watched her descend, rather slowly, owing to the dusk of the staircase, and he had a last sight of denham's head and of katharine's head near together, against the panels, when suddenly a pang of acute jealousy overcame him, and had he not remained conscious of the slippers upon his feet, he would have run after them or cried out. as it was he could not move from the spot. at the turn of the staircase katharine turned to look back, trusting to this last glance to seal their compact of good friendship. instead of returning her silent greeting, william grinned back at her a cold stare of sarcasm or of rage.  she stopped dead for a moment, and then descended slowly into the court. she looked to the right and to the left, and once up into the sky. she was only conscious of denham as a block upon her thoughts. she measured the distance that must be traversed before she would be alone. but when they came to the strand no cabs were to be seen, and denham broke the silence by saying:  "
Match 1527: "  "
Match 1528: " she agreed, paying no attention to him.  aware of her preoccupation, or absorbed in his own thoughts, ralph said nothing further; and in silence they walked some distance along the strand. ralph was doing his best to put his thoughts into such order that one came before the rest, and the determination that when he spoke he should speak worthily, made him put off the moment of speaking till he had found the exact words and even the place that best suited him. the strand was too busy. there was too much risk, also, of finding an empty cab. without a word of explanation he turned to the left, down one of the side streets leading to the river. on no account must they part until something of the very greatest importance had happened. he knew perfectly well what he wished to say, and had arranged not only the substance, but the order in which he was to say it. now, however, that he was alone with her, not only did he find the difficulty of speaking almost insurmountable, but he was aware that he was angry with her for thus disturbing him, and casting, as it was so easy for a person of her advantages to do, these phantoms and pitfalls across his path. he was determined that he would question her as severely as he would question himself; and make them both, once and for all, either justify her dominance or renounce it. but the longer they walked thus alone, the more he was disturbed by the sense of her actual presence. her skirt blew; the feathers in her hat waved; sometimes he saw her a step or two ahead of him, or had to wait for her to catch him up.  the silence was prolonged, and at length drew her attention to him. first she was annoyed that there was no cab to free her from his company; then she recalled vaguely something that mary had said to make her think ill of him; she could not remember what, but the recollection, combined with his masterful ways--why did he walk so fast down this side street?--made her more and more conscious of a person of marked, though disagreeable, force by her side. she stopped and, looking round her for a cab, sighted one in the distance. he was thus precipitated into speech.  "
Match 1529: " he asked. "
Match 1530: "  "
Match 1531: " she replied, guessing that his request had something to do with mary datchet.  "
Match 1532: " he said, and instantly he crossed over. "
Match 1533: " he began. but he paused so long that she could see his head against the sky; the slope of his thin cheek and his large, strong nose were clearly marked against it. while he paused, words that were quite different from those he intended to use presented themselves.  "
Match 1534: "  his words, and the queer strained voice in which he spoke them, made it appear as if he addressed some person who was not the woman beside him, but some one far away.  "
Match 1535: " he continued, filled with a sense of exaltation, and feeling that he had no need now to choose his words with pedantic accuracy, for what he wanted to say was suddenly become plain to him.  "
Match 1536: "  she had heard him so far with a feeling that she had dropped some material word which made sense of the rest. she could hear no more of this unintelligible rambling without checking him. she felt that she was overhearing what was meant for another.  "
Match 1537: " she said. "
Match 1538: "  "
Match 1539: " he replied, emphatically. he turned his head towards her. she recovered the words she was searching for while he spoke. "
Match 1540: " they came back to her in mary datchet's voice. her anger blazed up in her.  "
Match 1541: " she exclaimed.  he made a movement as if he were surprised or taken aback, but answered in a moment:  "
Match 1542: "  "
Match 1543: " katharine exclaimed, in surprise.  "
Match 1544: " he continued. "
Match 1545: "  "
Match 1546: " said katharine, "
Match 1547: " she spoke with an energy that was directed even more against herself than against him. "
Match 1548: " she continued, with the same energy, "
Match 1549: " she could now see plainly before her eyes the expression on mary datchet's face.  after a short pause, he said:  "
Match 1550: "  "
Match 1551: " she replied, conscious of some bewilderment.  "
Match 1552: " he added.  "
Match 1553: " she said at length.  as if obeying a common instinct, they both stopped and, bending slightly over the balustrade of the river, looked into the flowing water.  "
Match 1554: " ralph began. "
Match 1555: " he checked himself. "
Match 1556: "  simultaneously, they both walked on very slowly.  "
Match 1557: " she said. "
Match 1558: " she asked, recollecting the whole scene.  he bowed his head.  "
Match 1559: " he said.  she thought, with a start, that she was no longer engaged.  "
Match 1560: " he went on. "
Match 1561: " he said doggedly. "
Match 1562: " he added, as if arguing to himself, "
Match 1563: "  "
Match 1564: " she inquired.  "
Match 1565: "  "
Match 1566: " she asked, in amazement.  "
Match 1567: " he replied. he explained his meaning no further.  "
Match 1568: " she said at last, as he remained silent.  "
Match 1569: "  "
Match 1570: " she hesitated.  he controlled his wish to ask her to explain herself, and much to his pleasure she went on, appearing to search her mind.  "
Match 1571: "  "
Match 1572: " he said, in a low voice.  "
Match 1573: " she asked, after a break.  he told her in an orderly way, betokening careful preparation, all that he had meant to say at first; how he stood with regard to his brothers and sisters; what his mother had said, and his sister joan had refrained from saying; exactly how many pounds stood in his name at the bank; what prospect his brother had of earning a livelihood in america; how much of their income went on rent, and other details known to him by heart. she listened to all this, so that she could have passed an examination in it by the time waterloo bridge was in sight; and yet she was no more listening to it than she was counting the paving-stones at her feet. she was feeling happier than she had felt in her life. if denham could have seen how visibly books of algebraic symbols, pages all speckled with dots and dashes and twisted bars, came before her eyes as they trod the embankment, his secret joy in her attention might have been dispersed. she went on, saying, "
Match 1574: " so sensibly, that he had constantly to keep his brain in check; and all the time she was in fancy looking up through a telescope at white shadow-cleft disks which were other worlds, until she felt herself possessed of two bodies, one walking by the river with denham, the other concentrated to a silver globe aloft in the fine blue space above the scum of vapors that was covering the visible world. she looked at the sky once, and saw that no star was keen enough to pierce the flight of watery clouds now coursing rapidly before the west wind. she looked down hurriedly again. there was no reason, she assured herself, for this feeling of happiness; she was not free; she was not alone; she was still bound to earth by a million fibres; every step took her nearer home. nevertheless, she exulted as she had never exulted before. the air was fresher, the lights more distinct, the cold stone of the balustrade colder and harder, when by chance or purpose she struck her hand against it. no feeling of annoyance with denham remained; he certainly did not hinder any flight she might choose to make, whether in the direction of the sky or of her home; but that her condition was due to him, or to anything that he had said, she had no consciousness at all.  they were now within sight of the stream of cabs and omnibuses crossing to and from the surrey side of the river; the sound of the traffic, the hooting of motor-horns, and the light chime of tram-bells sounded more and more distinctly, and, with the increase of noise, they both became silent. with a common instinct they slackened their pace, as if to lengthen the time of semi-privacy allowed them. to ralph, the pleasure of these last yards of the walk with katharine was so great that he could not look beyond the present moment to the time when she should have left him. he had no wish to use the last moments of their companionship in adding fresh words to what he had already said. since they had stopped talking, she had become to him not so much a real person, as the very woman he dreamt of; but his solitary dreams had never produced any such keenness of sensation as that which he felt in her presence. he himself was also strangely transfigured. he had complete mastery of all his faculties. for the first time he was in possession of his full powers. the vistas which opened before him seemed to have no perceptible end. but the mood had none of the restlessness or feverish desire to add one delight to another which had hitherto marked, and somewhat spoilt, the most rapturous of his imaginings. it was a mood that took such clear-eyed account of the conditions of human life that he was not disturbed in the least by the gliding presence of a taxicab, and without agitation he perceived that katharine was conscious of it also, and turned her head in that direction. their halting steps acknowledged the desirability of engaging the cab; and they stopped simultaneously, and signed to it.  "
Match 1575: " he asked, with his hand on the door.  she hesitated for a moment. she could not immediately recall what the question was that she had to decide.  "
Match 1576: " she said vaguely. "
Match 1577: " she added, in a second, bethinking her of the difficulties of writing anything decided upon a question to which she had paid no attention, "
Match 1578: "  she stood looking at denham, considering and hesitating, with her foot upon the step. he guessed her difficulties; he knew in a second that she had heard nothing; he knew everything that she felt.  "
Match 1579: " he said quickly; "
Match 1580: "  "
Match 1581: "  "
Match 1582: " he repeated, with immense decision. he shut the door and gave her address to the driver. she instantly was conveyed away from him, and her cab joined the knotted stream of vehicles, each marked by a light, and indistinguishable one from the other. he stood watching for a moment, and then, as if swept by some fierce impulse, from the spot where they had stood, he turned, crossed the road at a rapid pace, and disappeared.  he walked on upon the impetus of this last mood of almost supernatural exaltation until he reached a narrow street, at this hour empty of traffic and passengers. here, whether it was the shops with their shuttered windows, the smooth and silvered curve of the wood pavement, or a natural ebb of feeling, his exaltation slowly oozed and deserted him. he was now conscious of the loss that follows any revelation; he had lost something in speaking to katharine, for, after all, was the katharine whom he loved the same as the real katharine? she had transcended her entirely at moments; her skirt had blown, her feather waved, her voice spoken; yes, but how terrible sometimes the pause between the voice of one's dreams and the voice that comes from the object of one's dreams! he felt a mixture of disgust and pity at the figure cut by human beings when they try to carry out, in practice, what they have the power to conceive. how small both he and katharine had appeared when they issued from the cloud of thought that enveloped them! he recalled the small, inexpressive, commonplace words in which they had tried to communicate with each other; he repeated them over to himself. by repeating katharine's words, he came in a few moments to such a sense of her presence that he worshipped her more than ever. but she was engaged to be married, he remembered with a start. the strength of his feeling was revealed to him instantly, and he gave himself up to an irresistible rage and sense of frustration. the image of rodney came before him with every circumstance of folly and indignity. that little pink-cheeked dancing-master to marry katharine? that gibbering ass with the face of a monkey on an organ? that posing, vain, fantastical fop? with his tragedies and his comedies, his innumerable spites and prides and pettinesses? lord! marry rodney! she must be as great a fool as he was. his bitterness took possession of him, and as he sat in the corner of the underground carriage, he looked as stark an image of unapproachable severity as could be imagined. directly he reached home he sat down at his table, and began to write katharine a long, wild, mad letter, begging her for both their sakes to break with rodney, imploring her not to do what would destroy for ever the one beauty, the one truth, the one hope; not to be a traitor, not to be a deserter, for if she were--and he wound up with a quiet and brief assertion that, whatever she did or left undone, he would believe to be the best, and accept from her with gratitude. he covered sheet after sheet, and heard the early carts starting for london before he went to bed.    chapter xxiv  the first signs of spring, even such as make themselves felt towards the middle of february, not only produce little white and violet flowers in the more sheltered corners of woods and gardens, but bring to birth thoughts and desires comparable to those faintly colored and sweetly scented petals in the minds of men and women. lives frozen by age, so far as the present is concerned, to a hard surface, which neither reflects nor yields, at this season become soft and fluid, reflecting the shapes and colors of the present, as well as the shapes and colors of the past. in the case of mrs. hilbery, these early spring days were chiefly upsetting inasmuch as they caused a general quickening of her emotional powers, which, as far as the past was concerned, had never suffered much diminution. but in the spring her desire for expression invariably increased. she was haunted by the ghosts of phrases. she gave herself up to a sensual delight in the combinations of words. she sought them in the pages of her favorite authors. she made them for herself on scraps of paper, and rolled them on her tongue when there seemed no occasion for such eloquence. she was upheld in these excursions by the certainty that no language could outdo the splendor of her father's memory, and although her efforts did not notably further the end of his biography, she was under the impression of living more in his shade at such times than at others. no one can escape the power of language, let alone those of english birth brought up from childhood, as mrs. hilbery had been, to disport themselves now in the saxon plainness, now in the latin splendor of the tongue, and stored with memories, as she was, of old poets exuberating in an infinity of vocables. even katharine was slightly affected against her better judgment by her mother's enthusiasm. not that her judgment could altogether acquiesce in the necessity for a study of shakespeare's sonnets as a preliminary to the fifth chapter of her grandfather's biography. beginning with a perfectly frivolous jest, mrs. hilbery had evolved a theory that anne hathaway had a way, among other things, of writing shakespeare's sonnets; the idea, struck out to enliven a party of professors, who forwarded a number of privately printed manuals within the next few days for her instruction, had submerged her in a flood of elizabethan literature; she had come half to believe in her joke, which was, she said, at least as good as other people's facts, and all her fancy for the time being centered upon stratford-on-avon. she had a plan, she told katharine, when, rather later than usual, katharine came into the room the morning after her walk by the river, for visiting shakespeare's tomb. any fact about the poet had become, for the moment, of far greater interest to her than the immediate present, and the certainty that there was existing in england a spot of ground where shakespeare had undoubtedly stood, where his very bones lay directly beneath one's feet, was so absorbing to her on this particular occasion that she greeted her daughter with the exclamation:  "
Match 1583: "  the question, for the moment, seemed to katharine to have reference to ralph denham.  "
Match 1584: " mrs. hilbery continued, "
Match 1585: "  katharine still looked about her in perplexity, and mrs. hilbery added:  "
Match 1586: "  then, perceiving her daughter's expression of perplexity, mrs. hilbery burst out laughing.  "
Match 1587: " she mused, standing at the window and tapping gently upon the pane, "
Match 1588: "  katharine sat down at her table and opened a long dusty envelope. as shelley was mentioned in the course of the letter as if he were alive, it had, of course, considerable value. her immediate task was to decide whether the whole letter should be printed, or only the paragraph which mentioned shelley's name, and she reached out for a pen and held it in readiness to do justice upon the sheet. her pen, however, remained in the air. almost surreptitiously she slipped a clean sheet in front of her, and her hand, descending, began drawing square boxes halved and quartered by straight lines, and then circles which underwent the same process of dissection.  "
Match 1589: " mrs. hilbery exclaimed--"
Match 1590: " she added wistfully, with a glance at her daughter, who had told her nothing about the dinner the night before.  "
Match 1591: " said katharine, hiding her slip of paper as her mother stood by her, and spreading the old letter about shelley in front of her.  "
Match 1592: " said mrs. hilbery. "
Match 1593: " she urged, "
Match 1594: "  katharine was on the point of interrupting her mother, and then she was on the point of confiding in her. they came strangely close together sometimes. but, while she hesitated and sought for words not too direct, her mother had recourse to shakespeare, and turned page after page, set upon finding some quotation which said all this about love far, far better than she could. accordingly, katharine did nothing but scrub one of her circles an intense black with her pencil, in the midst of which process the telephone-bell rang, and she left the room to answer it.  when she returned, mrs. hilbery had found not the passage she wanted, but another of exquisite beauty as she justly observed, looking up for a second to ask katharine who that was?  "
Match 1595: " katharine replied briefly.  "
Match 1596: "  she was cut short in her quotation by another imperative telephone-bell. once more katharine left the room.  "
Match 1597: " mrs. hilbery exclaimed on her return. "
Match 1598: "  "
Match 1599: " katharine replied yet more briefly.  "
Match 1600: "  "
Match 1601: "  "
Match 1602: "  "
Match 1603: " said katharine.  she swept her hand over the faded sheet, and drew herself up squarely to the table as if she refused to waste time any longer. the gesture was not lost upon her mother. it hinted at the existence of something stern and unapproachable in her daughter's character, which struck chill upon her, as the sight of poverty, or drunkenness, or the logic with which mr. hilbery sometimes thought good to demolish her certainty of an approaching millennium struck chill upon her. she went back to her own table, and putting on her spectacles with a curious expression of quiet humility, addressed herself for the first time that morning to the task before her. the shock with an unsympathetic world had a sobering effect on her. for once, her industry surpassed her daughter's. katharine could not reduce the world to that particular perspective in which harriet martineau, for instance, was a figure of solid importance, and possessed of a genuine relationship to this figure or to that date. singularly enough, the sharp call of the telephone-bell still echoed in her ear, and her body and mind were in a state of tension, as if, at any moment, she might hear another summons of greater interest to her than the whole of the nineteenth century. she did not clearly realize what this call was to be; but when the ears have got into the habit of listening, they go on listening involuntarily, and thus katharine spent the greater part of the morning in listening to a variety of sounds in the back streets of chelsea. for the first time in her life, probably, she wished that mrs. hilbery would not keep so closely to her work. a quotation from shakespeare would not have come amiss. now and again she heard a sigh from her mother's table, but that was the only proof she gave of her existence, and katharine did not think of connecting it with the square aspect of her own position at the table, or, perhaps, she would have thrown her pen down and told her mother the reason of her restlessness. the only writing she managed to accomplish in the course of the morning was one letter, addressed to her cousin, cassandra otway--a rambling letter, long, affectionate, playful and commanding all at once. she bade cassandra put her creatures in the charge of a groom, and come to them for a week or so. they would go and hear some music together. cassandra's dislike of rational society, she said, was an affectation fast hardening into a prejudice, which would, in the long run, isolate her from all interesting people and pursuits. she was finishing the sheet when the sound she was anticipating all the time actually struck upon her ears. she jumped up hastily, and slammed the door with a sharpness which made mrs. hilbery start. where was katharine off to? in her preoccupied state she had not heard the bell.  the alcove on the stairs, in which the telephone was placed, was screened for privacy by a curtain of purple velvet. it was a pocket for superfluous possessions, such as exist in most houses which harbor the wreckage of three generations. prints of great-uncles, famed for their prowess in the east, hung above chinese teapots, whose sides were riveted by little gold stitches, and the precious teapots, again, stood upon bookcases containing the complete works of william cowper and sir walter scott. the thread of sound, issuing from the telephone, was always colored by the surroundings which received it, so it seemed to katharine. whose voice was now going to combine with them, or to strike a discord?  "
Match 1604: " she asked herself, hearing a man inquire, with great determination, for her number. the unfamiliar voice now asked for miss hilbery. out of all the welter of voices which crowd round the far end of the telephone, out of the enormous range of possibilities, whose voice, what possibility, was this? a pause gave her time to ask herself this question. it was solved next moment.  "
Match 1605: "  with more than the usual sense of being impinged upon the point of a bayonet, katharine replied:  "
Match 1606: "  she dropped the machine, and looked fixedly at the print of the great-uncle who had not ceased to gaze, with an air of amiable authority, into a world which, as yet, beheld no symptoms of the indian mutiny. and yet, gently swinging against the wall, within the black tube, was a voice which recked nothing of uncle james, of china teapots, or of red velvet curtains. she watched the oscillation of the tube, and at the same moment became conscious of the individuality of the house in which she stood; she heard the soft domestic sounds of regular existence upon staircases and floors above her head, and movements through the wall in the house next door. she had no very clear vision of denham himself, when she lifted the telephone to her lips and replied that she thought saturday would suit her. she hoped that he would not say good-bye at once, although she felt no particular anxiety to attend to what he was saying, and began, even while he spoke, to think of her own upper room, with its books, its papers pressed between the leaves of dictionaries, and the table that could be cleared for work. she replaced the instrument, thoughtfully; her restlessness was assuaged; she finished her letter to cassandra without difficulty, addressed the envelope, and fixed the stamp with her usual quick decision.  a bunch of anemones caught mrs. hilbery's eye when they had finished luncheon. the blue and purple and white of the bowl, standing in a pool of variegated light on a polished chippendale table in the drawing-room window, made her stop dead with an exclamation of pleasure.  "
Match 1607: " she demanded. "
Match 1608: " she concluded, but for the moment the name of this desirable acquaintance escaped her. the best representative of the forlorn company whose day would be brightened by a bunch of anemones was, in katharine's opinion, the widow of a general living in the cromwell road. in default of the actually destitute and starving, whom she would much have preferred, mrs. hilbery was forced to acknowledge her claims, for though in comfortable circumstances, she was extremely dull, unattractive, connected in some oblique fashion with literature, and had been touched to the verge of tears, on one occasion, by an afternoon call.  it happened that mrs. hilbery had an engagement elsewhere, so that the task of taking the flowers to the cromwell road fell upon katharine. she took her letter to cassandra with her, meaning to post it in the first pillar-box she came to. when, however, she was fairly out of doors, and constantly invited by pillar-boxes and post-offices to slip her envelope down their scarlet throats, she forbore. she made absurd excuses, as that she did not wish to cross the road, or that she was certain to pass another post-office in a more central position a little farther on. the longer she held the letter in her hand, however, the more persistently certain questions pressed upon her, as if from a collection of voices in the air. these invisible people wished to be informed whether she was engaged to william rodney, or was the engagement broken off? was it right, they asked, to invite cassandra for a visit, and was william rodney in love with her, or likely to fall in love? then the questioners paused for a moment, and resumed as if another side of the problem had just come to their notice. what did ralph denham mean by what he said to you last night? do you consider that he is in love with you? is it right to consent to a solitary walk with him, and what advice are you going to give him about his future? has william rodney cause to be jealous of your conduct, and what do you propose to do about mary datchet? what are you going to do? what does honor require you to do? they repeated.  "
Match 1609: " katharine exclaimed, after listening to all these remarks, "
Match 1610: "  but the debate was a formal skirmishing, a pastime to gain breathing-space. like all people brought up in a tradition, katharine was able, within ten minutes or so, to reduce any moral difficulty to its traditional shape and solve it by the traditional answers. the book of wisdom lay open, if not upon her mother's knee, upon the knees of many uncles and aunts. she had only to consult them, and they would at once turn to the right page and read out an answer exactly suited to one in her position. the rules which should govern the behavior of an unmarried woman are written in red ink, graved upon marble, if, by some freak of nature, it should fall out that the unmarried woman has not the same writing scored upon her heart. she was ready to believe that some people are fortunate enough to reject, accept, resign, or lay down their lives at the bidding of traditional authority; she could envy them; but in her case the questions became phantoms directly she tried seriously to find an answer, which proved that the traditional answer would be of no use to her individually. yet it had served so many people, she thought, glancing at the rows of houses on either side of her, where families, whose incomes must be between a thousand and fifteen-hundred a year lived, and kept, perhaps, three servants, and draped their windows with curtains which were always thick and generally dirty, and must, she thought, since you could only see a looking-glass gleaming above a sideboard on which a dish of apples was set, keep the room inside very dark. but she turned her head away, observing that this was not a method of thinking the matter out.  the only truth which she could discover was the truth of what she herself felt--a frail beam when compared with the broad illumination shed by the eyes of all the people who are in agreement to see together; but having rejected the visionary voices, she had no choice but to make this her guide through the dark masses which confronted her. she tried to follow her beam, with an expression upon her face which would have made any passer-by think her reprehensibly and almost ridiculously detached from the surrounding scene. one would have felt alarmed lest this young and striking woman were about to do something eccentric. but her beauty saved her from the worst fate that can befall a pedestrian; people looked at her, but they did not laugh. to seek a true feeling among the chaos of the unfeelings or half-feelings of life, to recognize it when found, and to accept the consequences of the discovery, draws lines upon the smoothest brow, while it quickens the light of the eyes; it is a pursuit which is alternately bewildering, debasing, and exalting, and, as katharine speedily found, her discoveries gave her equal cause for surprise, shame, and intense anxiety. much depended, as usual, upon the interpretation of the word love; which word came up again and again, whether she considered rodney, denham, mary datchet, or herself; and in each case it seemed to stand for something different, and yet for something unmistakable and something not to be passed by. for the more she looked into the confusion of lives which, instead of running parallel, had suddenly intersected each other, the more distinctly she seemed to convince herself that there was no other light on them than was shed by this strange illumination, and no other path save the one upon which it threw its beams. her blindness in the case of rodney, her attempt to match his true feeling with her false feeling, was a failure never to be sufficiently condemned; indeed, she could only pay it the tribute of leaving it a black and naked landmark unburied by attempt at oblivion or excuse.  with this to humiliate there was much to exalt. she thought of three different scenes; she thought of mary sitting upright and saying, "
Match 1611: "; she thought of rodney losing his self-consciousness among the dead leaves, and speaking with the abandonment of a child; she thought of denham leaning upon the stone parapet and talking to the distant sky, so that she thought him mad. her mind, passing from mary to denham, from william to cassandra, and from denham to herself--if, as she rather doubted, denham's state of mind was connected with herself--seemed to be tracing out the lines of some symmetrical pattern, some arrangement of life, which invested, if not herself, at least the others, not only with interest, but with a kind of tragic beauty. she had a fantastic picture of them upholding splendid palaces upon their bent backs. they were the lantern-bearers, whose lights, scattered among the crowd, wove a pattern, dissolving, joining, meeting again in combination. half forming such conceptions as these in her rapid walk along the dreary streets of south kensington, she determined that, whatever else might be obscure, she must further the objects of mary, denham, william, and cassandra. the way was not apparent. no course of action seemed to her indubitably right. all she achieved by her thinking was the conviction that, in such a cause, no risk was too great; and that, far from making any rules for herself or others, she would let difficulties accumulate unsolved, situations widen their jaws unsatiated, while she maintained a position of absolute and fearless independence. so she could best serve the people who loved.  read in the light of this exaltation, there was a new meaning in the words which her mother had penciled upon the card attached to the bunch of anemones. the door of the house in the cromwell road opened; gloomy vistas of passage and staircase were revealed; such light as there was seemed to be concentrated upon a silver salver of visiting-cards, whose black borders suggested that the widow's friends had all suffered the same bereavement. the parlor-maid could hardly be expected to fathom the meaning of the grave tone in which the young lady proffered the flowers, with mrs. hilbery's love; and the door shut upon the offering.  the sight of a face, the slam of a door, are both rather destructive of exaltation in the abstract; and, as she walked back to chelsea, katharine had her doubts whether anything would come of her resolves. if you cannot make sure of people, however, you can hold fairly fast to figures, and in some way or other her thought about such problems as she was wont to consider worked in happily with her mood as to her friends' lives. she reached home rather late for tea.  on the ancient dutch chest in the hall she perceived one or two hats, coats, and walking-sticks, and the sound of voices reached her as she stood outside the drawing-room door. her mother gave a little cry as she came in; a cry which conveyed to katharine the fact that she was late, that the teacups and milk-jugs were in a conspiracy of disobedience, and that she must immediately take her place at the head of the table and pour out tea for the guests. augustus pelham, the diarist, liked a calm atmosphere in which to tell his stories; he liked attention; he liked to elicit little facts, little stories, about the past and the great dead, from such distinguished characters as mrs. hilbery for the nourishment of his diary, for whose sake he frequented tea-tables and ate yearly an enormous quantity of buttered toast. he, therefore, welcomed katharine with relief, and she had merely to shake hands with rodney and to greet the american lady who had come to be shown the relics, before the talk started again on the broad lines of reminiscence and discussion which were familiar to her.  yet, even with this thick veil between them, she could not help looking at rodney, as if she could detect what had happened to him since they met. it was in vain. his clothes, even the white slip, the pearl in his tie, seemed to intercept her quick glance, and to proclaim the futility of such inquiries of a discreet, urbane gentleman, who balanced his cup of tea and poised a slice of bread and butter on the edge of the saucer. he would not meet her eye, but that could be accounted for by his activity in serving and helping, and the polite alacrity with which he was answering the questions of the american visitor.  it was certainly a sight to daunt any one coming in with a head full of theories about love. the voices of the invisible questioners were reinforced by the scene round the table, and sounded with a tremendous self-confidence, as if they had behind them the common sense of twenty generations, together with the immediate approval of mr. augustus pelham, mrs. vermont bankes, william rodney, and, possibly, mrs. hilbery herself. katharine set her teeth, not entirely in the metaphorical sense, for her hand, obeying the impulse towards definite action, laid firmly upon the table beside her an envelope which she had been grasping all this time in complete forgetfulness. the address was uppermost, and a moment later she saw william's eye rest upon it as he rose to fulfil some duty with a plate. his expression instantly changed. he did what he was on the point of doing, and then looked at katharine with a look which revealed enough of his confusion to show her that he was not entirely represented by his appearance. in a minute or two he proved himself at a loss with mrs. vermont bankes, and mrs. hilbery, aware of the silence with her usual quickness, suggested that, perhaps, it was now time that mrs. bankes should be shown "
Match 1612: "  katharine accordingly rose, and led the way to the little inner room with the pictures and the books. mrs. bankes and rodney followed her.  she turned on the lights, and began directly in her low, pleasant voice: "
Match 1613: " she took it in her hand and paused for the right number of seconds. "
Match 1614: " she continued, "
Match 1615: " she added, as mrs. bankes asked, in an awestruck tone of voice, for that privilege, and began a preliminary unbuttoning of her white kid gloves.  "
Match 1616: " the american lady observed, gazing from katharine to the portrait, "
Match 1617: " she asked in a jocular tone, turning to william. "
Match 1618: " laying aside the manuscript, she hastily grasped the old shoes, and remained for a moment dumb in contemplation of them.  while katharine went on steadily with her duties as show-woman, rodney examined intently a row of little drawings which he knew by heart already. his disordered state of mind made it necessary for him to take advantage of these little respites, as if he had been out in a high wind and must straighten his dress in the first shelter he reached. his calm was only superficial, as he knew too well; it did not exist much below the surface of tie, waistcoat, and white slip.  on getting out of bed that morning he had fully made up his mind to ignore what had been said the night before; he had been convinced, by the sight of denham, that his love for katharine was passionate, and when he addressed her early that morning on the telephone, he had meant his cheerful but authoritative tones to convey to her the fact that, after a night of madness, they were as indissolubly engaged as ever. but when he reached his office his torments began. he found a letter from cassandra waiting for him. she had read his play, and had taken the very first opportunity to write and tell him what she thought of it. she knew, she wrote, that her praise meant absolutely nothing; but still, she had sat up all night; she thought this, that, and the other; she was full of enthusiasm most elaborately scratched out in places, but enough was written plain to gratify william's vanity exceedingly. she was quite intelligent enough to say the right things, or, even more charmingly, to hint at them. in other ways, too, it was a very charming letter. she told him about her music, and about a suffrage meeting to which henry had taken her, and she asserted, half seriously, that she had learnt the greek alphabet, and found it "
Match 1619: " the word was underlined. had she laughed when she drew that line? was she ever serious? didn't the letter show the most engaging compound of enthusiasm and spirit and whimsicality, all tapering into a flame of girlish freakishness, which flitted, for the rest of the morning, as a will-o'-the-wisp, across rodney's landscape. he could not resist beginning an answer to her there and then. he found it particularly delightful to shape a style which should express the bowing and curtsying, advancing and retreating, which are characteristic of one of the many million partnerships of men and women. katharine never trod that particular measure, he could not help reflecting; katharine--cassandra; cassandra--katharine--they alternated in his consciousness all day long. it was all very well to dress oneself carefully, compose one's face, and start off punctually at half-past four to a tea-party in cheyne walk, but heaven only knew what would come of it all, and when katharine, after sitting silent with her usual immobility, wantonly drew from her pocket and slapped down on the table beneath his eyes a letter addressed to cassandra herself, his composure deserted him. what did she mean by her behavior?  he looked up sharply from his row of little pictures. katharine was disposing of the american lady in far too arbitrary a fashion. surely the victim herself must see how foolish her enthusiasms appeared in the eyes of the poet's granddaughter. katharine never made any attempt to spare people's feelings, he reflected; and, being himself very sensitive to all shades of comfort and discomfort, he cut short the auctioneer's catalog, which katharine was reeling off more and more absent-mindedly, and took mrs. vermont bankes, with a queer sense of fellowship in suffering, under his own protection.  but within a few minutes the american lady had completed her inspection, and inclining her head in a little nod of reverential farewell to the poet and his shoes, she was escorted downstairs by rodney. katharine stayed by herself in the little room. the ceremony of ancestor-worship had been more than usually oppressive to her. moreover, the room was becoming crowded beyond the bounds of order. only that morning a heavily insured proof-sheet had reached them from a collector in australia, which recorded a change of the poet's mind about a very famous phrase, and, therefore, had claims to the honor of glazing and framing. but was there room for it? must it be hung on the staircase, or should some other relic give place to do it honor? feeling unable to decide the question, katharine glanced at the portrait of her grandfather, as if to ask his opinion. the artist who had painted it was now out of fashion, and by dint of showing it to visitors, katharine had almost ceased to see anything but a glow of faintly pleasing pink and brown tints, enclosed within a circular scroll of gilt laurel-leaves. the young man who was her grandfather looked vaguely over her head. the sensual lips were slightly parted, and gave the face an expression of beholding something lovely or miraculous vanishing or just rising upon the rim of the distance. the expression repeated itself curiously upon katharine's face as she gazed up into his. they were the same age, or very nearly so. she wondered what he was looking for; were there waves beating upon a shore for him, too, she wondered, and heroes riding through the leaf-hung forests? for perhaps the first time in her life she thought of him as a man, young, unhappy, tempestuous, full of desires and faults; for the first time she realized him for herself, and not from her mother's memory. he might have been her brother, she thought. it seemed to her that they were akin, with the mysterious kinship of blood which makes it seem possible to interpret the sights which the eyes of the dead behold so intently, or even to believe that they look with us upon our present joys and sorrows. he would have understood, she thought, suddenly; and instead of laying her withered flowers upon his shrine, she brought him her own perplexities--perhaps a gift of greater value, should the dead be conscious of gifts, than flowers and incense and adoration. doubts, questionings, and despondencies she felt, as she looked up, would be more welcome to him than homage, and he would hold them but a very small burden if she gave him, also, some share in what she suffered and achieved. the depth of her own pride and love were not more apparent to her than the sense that the dead asked neither flowers nor regrets, but a share in the life which they had given her, the life which they had lived.  rodney found her a moment later sitting beneath her grandfather's portrait. she laid her hand on the seat next her in a friendly way, and said:  "
Match 1620: "  "
Match 1621: " he returned dryly.  "
Match 1622: " she told him how she had taken the flowers to mrs. mccormick, and how south kensington impressed her as the preserve of officers' widows. she described how the door had opened, and what gloomy avenues of busts and palm-trees and umbrellas had been revealed to her. she spoke lightly, and succeeded in putting him at his ease. indeed, he rapidly became too much at his ease to persist in a condition of cheerful neutrality. he felt his composure slipping from him. katharine made it seem so natural to ask her to help him, or advise him, to say straight out what he had in his mind. the letter from cassandra was heavy in his pocket. there was also the letter to cassandra lying on the table in the next room. the atmosphere seemed charged with cassandra. but, unless katharine began the subject of her own accord, he could not even hint--he must ignore the whole affair; it was the part of a gentleman to preserve a bearing that was, as far as he could make it, the bearing of an undoubting lover. at intervals he sighed deeply. he talked rather more quickly than usual about the possibility that some of the operas of mozart would be played in the summer. he had received a notice, he said, and at once produced a pocket-book stuffed with papers, and began shuffling them in search. he held a thick envelope between his finger and thumb, as if the notice from the opera company had become in some way inseparably attached to it.  "
Match 1623: " said katharine, in the easiest voice in the world, looking over his shoulder. "
Match 1624: "  he handed her the envelope in silence. she took it, extracted the sheets, and read the letter through.  the reading seemed to rodney to take an intolerably long time.  "
Match 1625: " she observed at length, "
Match 1626: "  rodney's face was half turned away, as if in bashfulness. her view of his profile almost moved her to laughter. she glanced through the pages once more.  "
Match 1627: " william blurted out, "
Match 1628: "  "
Match 1629: " said katharine, consulting the pages once more. "
Match 1630: "  "
Match 1631: "  "
Match 1632: "  "
Match 1633: " he floundered, "
Match 1634: "  she was surprised by the violence of her desire that he never should think of it again. for an instant it seemed to her impossible to surrender an intimacy, which might not be the intimacy of love, but was certainly the intimacy of true friendship, to any woman in the world. cassandra would never understand him--she was not good enough for him. the letter seemed to her a letter of flattery--a letter addressed to his weakness, which it made her angry to think was known to another. for he was not weak; he had the rare strength of doing what he promised--she had only to speak, and he would never think of cassandra again.  she paused. rodney guessed the reason. he was amazed.  "
Match 1635: " he thought. the woman he admired more than any one in the world, loved him, as he had given up hope that she would ever love him. and now that for the first time he was sure of her love, he resented it. he felt it as a fetter, an encumbrance, something which made them both, but him in particular, ridiculous. he was in her power completely, but his eyes were open and he was no longer her slave or her dupe. he would be her master in future. the instant prolonged itself as katharine realized the strength of her desire to speak the words that should keep william for ever, and the baseness of the temptation which assailed her to make the movement, or speak the word, which he had often begged her for, which she was now near enough to feeling. she held the letter in her hand. she sat silent.  at this moment there was a stir in the other room; the voice of mrs. hilbery was heard talking of proof-sheets rescued by miraculous providence from butcher's ledgers in australia; the curtain separating one room from the other was drawn apart, and mrs. hilbery and augustus pelham stood in the doorway. mrs. hilbery stopped short. she looked at her daughter, and at the man her daughter was to marry, with her peculiar smile that always seemed to tremble on the brink of satire.  "
Match 1636: " she exclaimed. "
Match 1637: "  mr. pelham looked, smiled, bowed, and, as his hostess had moved on, followed her without a word. the curtain was drawn again either by him or by mrs. hilbery.  but her mother had settled the question somehow. katharine doubted no longer.  "
Match 1638: " she said, "
Match 1639: "  "
Match 1640: " said rodney, with an immediate return to the manner of a formal man of honor.  "
Match 1641: " said katharine.  directly he left her she would go to her mother, and explain that the engagement was at an end--or it might be better that they should go together?  "
Match 1642: " rodney began, nervously attempting to stuff cassandra's sheets back into their envelope; "
Match 1643: "  "
Match 1644: "  he crossed his knees in a discomfited silence. by all his codes it was impossible to ask a woman with whom he had just broken off his engagement to help him to become acquainted with another woman with a view to his falling in love with her. if it was announced that their engagement was over, a long and complete separation would inevitably follow; in those circumstances, letters and gifts were returned; after years of distance the severed couple met, perhaps at an evening party, and touched hands uncomfortably with an indifferent word or two. he would be cast off completely; he would have to trust to his own resources. he could never mention cassandra to katharine again; for months, and doubtless years, he would never see katharine again; anything might happen to her in his absence.  katharine was almost as well aware of his perplexities as he was. she knew in what direction complete generosity pointed the way; but pride--for to remain engaged to rodney and to cover his experiments hurt what was nobler in her than mere vanity--fought for its life.  "
Match 1645: " she thought, "
Match 1646: "  when she reached this point, rodney pocketed the letter and elaborately looked at his watch. although the action meant that he resigned cassandra, for he knew his own incompetence and distrusted himself entirely, and lost katharine, for whom his feeling was profound though unsatisfactory, still it appeared to him that there was nothing else left for him to do. he was forced to go, leaving katharine free, as he had said, to tell her mother that the engagement was at an end. but to do what plain duty required of an honorable man, cost an effort which only a day or two ago would have been inconceivable to him. that a relationship such as he had glanced at with desire could be possible between him and katharine, he would have been the first, two days ago, to deny with indignation. but now his life had changed; his attitude had changed; his feelings were different; new aims and possibilities had been shown him, and they had an almost irresistible fascination and force. the training of a life of thirty-five years had not left him defenceless; he was still master of his dignity; he rose, with a mind made up to an irrevocable farewell.  "
Match 1647: " he said, standing up and holding out his hand with an effort that left him pale, but lent him dignity, "
Match 1648: "  she took his hand and held it.  "
Match 1649: " she said.  "
Match 1650: " he replied.  "

Match 1673: " rodney groaned, as he reviewed the situation into which her christian doctrine was plunging them.  and yet he could not deny that a divine relief possessed him, and that the future, instead of wearing a lead-colored mask, now blossomed with a thousand varied gaieties and excitements. he was actually to see cassandra within a week or perhaps less, and he was more anxious to know the date of her arrival than he could own even to himself. it seemed base to be so anxious to pluck this fruit of katharine's unexampled generosity and of his own contemptible baseness. and yet, though he used these words automatically, they had now no meaning. he was not debased in his own eyes by what he had done, and as for praising katharine, were they not partners, conspirators, people bent upon the same quest together, so that to praise the pursuit of a common end as an act of generosity was meaningless. he took her hand and pressed it, not in thanks so much as in an ecstasy of comradeship.  "
Match 1674: " he said, repeating her words, seeking her eyes in an enthusiasm of friendship.  her eyes were grave but dark with sadness as they rested on him. "
Match 1675: " she thought, "
Match 1676: " and the fancy came to her that, as they sat side by side, hand in hand, she could hear the earth pouring from above to make a barrier between them, so that, as they sat, they were separated second by second by an impenetrable wall. the process, which affected her as that of being sealed away and for ever from all companionship with the person she cared for most, came to an end at last, and by common consent they unclasped their fingers, rodney touching hers with his lips, as the curtain parted, and mrs. hilbery peered through the opening with her benevolent and sarcastic expression to ask whether katharine could remember was it tuesday or wednesday, and did she dine in westminster?  "
Match 1677: " she said, pausing, as if she could not resist the pleasure of encroaching for a second upon this wonderful world of love and confidence and romance. "
Match 1678: " she added, disappearing with an impulsive gesture, as if she forced herself to draw the curtain upon a scene which she refused all temptation to interrupt.    chapter xxv  at a quarter-past three in the afternoon of the following saturday ralph denham sat on the bank of the lake in kew gardens, dividing the dial-plate of his watch into sections with his forefinger. the just and inexorable nature of time itself was reflected in his face. he might have been composing a hymn to the unhasting and unresting march of that divinity. he seemed to greet the lapse of minute after minute with stern acquiescence in the inevitable order. his expression was so severe, so serene, so immobile, that it seemed obvious that for him at least there was a grandeur in the departing hour which no petty irritation on his part was to mar, although the wasting time wasted also high private hopes of his own.  his face was no bad index to what went on within him. he was in a condition of mind rather too exalted for the trivialities of daily life. he could not accept the fact that a lady was fifteen minutes late in keeping her appointment without seeing in that accident the frustration of his entire life. looking at his watch, he seemed to look deep into the springs of human existence, and by the light of what he saw there altered his course towards the north and the midnight.... yes, one's voyage must be made absolutely without companions through ice and black water--towards what goal? here he laid his finger upon the half-hour, and decided that when the minute-hand reached that point he would go, at the same time answering the question put by another of the many voices of consciousness with the reply that there was undoubtedly a goal, but that it would need the most relentless energy to keep anywhere in its direction. still, still, one goes on, the ticking seconds seemed to assure him, with dignity, with open eyes, with determination not to accept the second-rate, not to be tempted by the unworthy, not to yield, not to compromise. twenty-five minutes past three were now marked upon the face of the watch. the world, he assured himself, since katharine hilbery was now half an hour behind her time, offers no happiness, no rest from struggle, no certainty. in a scheme of things utterly bad from the start the only unpardonable folly is that of hope. raising his eyes for a moment from the face of his watch, he rested them upon the opposite bank, reflectively and not without a certain wistfulness, as if the sternness of their gaze were still capable of mitigation. soon a look of the deepest satisfaction filled them, though, for a moment, he did not move. he watched a lady who came rapidly, and yet with a trace of hesitation, down the broad grass-walk towards him. she did not see him. distance lent her figure an indescribable height, and romance seemed to surround her from the floating of a purple veil which the light air filled and curved from her shoulders.  "
Match 1679: " he said to himself, half remembering some line from a play or poem where the heroine bore down thus with feathers flying and airs saluting her. the greenery and the high presences of the trees surrounded her as if they stood forth at her coming. he rose, and she saw him; her little exclamation proved that she was glad to find him, and then that she blamed herself for being late.  "
Match 1680: " she remarked, alluding to the lake, the broad green space, the vista of trees, with the ruffled gold of the thames in the distance and the ducal castle standing in its meadows. she paid the rigid tail of the ducal lion the tribute of incredulous laughter.  "
Match 1681: " denham remarked.  but it appeared that she had come once as a small child, when the geography of the place was entirely different, and the fauna included certainly flamingoes and, possibly, camels. they strolled on, refashioning these legendary gardens. she was, as he felt, glad merely to stroll and loiter and let her fancy touch upon anything her eyes encountered--a bush, a park-keeper, a decorated goose--as if the relaxation soothed her. the warmth of the afternoon, the first of spring, tempted them to sit upon a seat in a glade of beech-trees, with forest drives striking green paths this way and that around them. she sighed deeply.  "
Match 1682: " she said, as if in explanation of her sigh. not a single person was in sight, and the stir of the wind in the branches, that sound so seldom heard by londoners, seemed to her as if wafted from fathomless oceans of sweet air in the distance.  while she breathed and looked, denham was engaged in uncovering with the point of his stick a group of green spikes half smothered by the dead leaves. he did this with the peculiar touch of the botanist. in naming the little green plant to her he used the latin name, thus disguising some flower familiar even to chelsea, and making her exclaim, half in amusement, at his knowledge. her own ignorance was vast, she confessed. what did one call that tree opposite, for instance, supposing one condescended to call it by its english name? beech or elm or sycamore? it chanced, by the testimony of a dead leaf, to be oak; and a little attention to a diagram which denham proceeded to draw upon an envelope soon put katharine in possession of some of the fundamental distinctions between our british trees. she then asked him to inform her about flowers. to her they were variously shaped and colored petals, poised, at different seasons of the year, upon very similar green stalks; but to him they were, in the first instance, bulbs or seeds, and later, living things endowed with sex, and pores, and susceptibilities which adapted themselves by all manner of ingenious devices to live and beget life, and could be fashioned squat or tapering, flame-colored or pale, pure or spotted, by processes which might reveal the secrets of human existence. denham spoke with increasing ardor of a hobby which had long been his in secret. no discourse could have worn a more welcome sound in katharine's ears. for weeks she had heard nothing that made such pleasant music in her mind. it wakened echoes in all those remote fastnesses of her being where loneliness had brooded so long undisturbed.  she wished he would go on for ever talking of plants, and showing her how science felt not quite blindly for the law that ruled their endless variations. a law that might be inscrutable but was certainly omnipotent appealed to her at the moment, because she could find nothing like it in possession of human lives. circumstances had long forced her, as they force most women in the flower of youth, to consider, painfully and minutely, all that part of life which is conspicuously without order; she had had to consider moods and wishes, degrees of liking or disliking, and their effect upon the destiny of people dear to her; she had been forced to deny herself any contemplation of that other part of life where thought constructs a destiny which is independent of human beings. as denham spoke, she followed his words and considered their bearing with an easy vigor which spoke of a capacity long hoarded and unspent. the very trees and the green merging into the blue distance became symbols of the vast external world which recks so little of the happiness, of the marriages or deaths of individuals. in order to give her examples of what he was saying, denham led the way, first to the rock garden, and then to the orchid house.  for him there was safety in the direction which the talk had taken. his emphasis might come from feelings more personal than those science roused in him, but it was disguised, and naturally he found it easy to expound and explain. nevertheless, when he saw katharine among the orchids, her beauty strangely emphasized by the fantastic plants, which seemed to peer and gape at her from striped hoods and fleshy throats, his ardor for botany waned, and a more complex feeling replaced it. she fell silent. the orchids seemed to suggest absorbing reflections. in defiance of the rules she stretched her ungloved hand and touched one. the sight of the rubies upon her finger affected him so disagreeably that he started and turned away. but next moment he controlled himself; he looked at her taking in one strange shape after another with the contemplative, considering gaze of a person who sees not exactly what is before him, but gropes in regions that lie beyond it. the far-away look entirely lacked self-consciousness. denham doubted whether she remembered his presence. he could recall himself, of course, by a word or a movement--but why? she was happier thus. she needed nothing that he could give her. and for him, too, perhaps, it was best to keep aloof, only to know that she existed, to preserve what he already had--perfect, remote, and unbroken. further, her still look, standing among the orchids in that hot atmosphere, strangely illustrated some scene that he had imagined in his room at home. the sight, mingling with his recollection, kept him silent when the door was shut and they were walking on again.  but though she did not speak, katharine had an uneasy sense that silence on her part was selfishness. it was selfish of her to continue, as she wished to do, a discussion of subjects not remotely connected with any human beings. she roused herself to consider their exact position upon the turbulent map of the emotions. oh yes--it was a question whether ralph denham should live in the country and write a book; it was getting late; they must waste no more time; cassandra arrived to-night for dinner; she flinched and roused herself, and discovered that she ought to be holding something in her hands. but they were empty. she held them out with an exclamation.  "
Match 1683: " the gardens had no points of the compass, so far as she was concerned. she had been walking for the most part on grass--that was all she knew. even the road to the orchid house had now split itself into three. but there was no bag in the orchid house. it must, therefore, have been left upon the seat. they retraced their steps in the preoccupied manner of people who have to think about something that is lost. what did this bag look like? what did it contain?  "
Match 1684: " katharine counted, becoming more agitated as she recalled the list. denham went on quickly in advance of her, and she heard him shout that he had found it before she reached the seat. in order to make sure that all was safe she spread the contents on her knee. it was a queer collection, denham thought, gazing with the deepest interest. loose gold coins were tangled in a narrow strip of lace; there were letters which somehow suggested the extreme of intimacy; there were two or three keys, and lists of commissions against which crosses were set at intervals. but she did not seem satisfied until she had made sure of a certain paper so folded that denham could not judge what it contained. in her relief and gratitude she began at once to say that she had been thinking over what denham had told her of his plans.  he cut her short.

Match 1718: " he expostulated.  "
Match 1719: " she said, laughing and looking at him. how arbitrary, hot-tempered, and imperious he was! he had asked her to come to kew to advise him; he then told her that he had settled the question already; he then proceeded to find fault with her. he was the very opposite of william rodney, she thought; he was shabby, his clothes were badly made, he was ill versed in the amenities of life; he was tongue-tied and awkward to the verge of obliterating his real character. he was awkwardly silent; he was awkwardly emphatic. and yet she liked him.  "
Match 1720: " she repeated good-humoredly. "
Match 1721: "  "
Match 1722: " he answered significantly.  she flushed. he had penetrated at once to the weak spot--her engagement, and had reason for what he said. he was not altogether justified now, at any rate, she was glad to remember; but she could not enlighten him and must bear his insinuations, though from the lips of a man who had behaved as he had behaved their force should not have been sharp. nevertheless, what he said had its force, she mused; partly because he seemed unconscious of his own lapse in the case of mary datchet, and thus baffled her insight; partly because he always spoke with force, for what reason she did not yet feel certain.  "
Match 1723: " she inquired, with a touch of irony.  "
Match 1724: " he replied a little vaguely. he was ashamed of his savage wish to hurt her, and yet it was not for the sake of hurting her, who was beyond his shafts, but in order to mortify his own incredibly reckless impulse of abandonment to the spirit which seemed, at moments, about to rush him to the uttermost ends of the earth. she affected him beyond the scope of his wildest dreams. he seemed to see that beneath the quiet surface of her manner, which was almost pathetically at hand and within reach for all the trivial demands of daily life, there was a spirit which she reserved or repressed for some reason either of loneliness or--could it be possible--of love. was it given to rodney to see her unmasked, unrestrained, unconscious of her duties? a creature of uncalculating passion and instinctive freedom? no; he refused to believe it. it was in her loneliness that katharine was unreserved. "
Match 1725: " she had said that to him, and in saying it had given him a glimpse of possibilities, even of confidences, as if he might be the one to share her loneliness, the mere hint of which made his heart beat faster and his brain spin. he checked himself as brutally as he could. he saw her redden, and in the irony of her reply he heard her resentment.  he began slipping his smooth, silver watch in his pocket, in the hope that somehow he might help himself back to that calm and fatalistic mood which had been his when he looked at its face upon the bank of the lake, for that mood must, at whatever cost, be the mood of his intercourse with katharine. he had spoken of gratitude and acquiescence in the letter which he had never sent, and now all the force of his character must make good those vows in her presence.  she, thus challenged, tried meanwhile to define her points. she wished to make denham understand.  "
Match 1726: " she inquired. "
Match 1727: " her reasoning suspended itself a little inconclusively, for the subject was complex, and she found herself in ignorance whether denham had a family or not. denham was agreed with her as to the destructiveness of the family system, but he did not wish to discuss the problem at that moment.  he turned to a problem which was of greater interest to him.  "
Match 1728: " he said, "
Match 1729: "  "
Match 1730: " she agreed, a little despondently. "
Match 1731: "--in the condition in which she found herself, she meant, but added lamely--"
Match 1732: "  "
Match 1733: " denham instantly intervened, "
Match 1734: " he continued, with a reasonable intonation which did much credit to his self-control, "
Match 1735: "  she was curious to hear them, but, besides feeling that the topic concealed dangers better known to her than to him, she was reminded by his tone of his curious abstract declaration upon the embankment. anything that hinted at love for the moment alarmed her; it was as much an infliction to her as the rubbing of a skinless wound.  but he went on, without waiting for her invitation.  "
Match 1736: " he laid it down emphatically. "
Match 1737: "  "
Match 1738: " she asked.  "
Match 1739: " he replied. the word  was one that she had been using frequently in her arguments with herself of late.  "
Match 1740: " he concluded.  "
Match 1741: " she said reflectively.  "
Match 1742: " he said, "
Match 1743: " she had known that this was coming, but, none the less, felt a little shock, half of pleasure, half of reluctance, when she heard the formal statement.  "
Match 1744: " she began, "
Match 1745: "  "
Match 1746: "  "
Match 1747: " she replied quickly.  "
Match 1748: " she went on, and again came to an end. she had been touched by the unreserved and yet ceremonious way in which he had made what he called his offer of terms, but if he was generous it was the more necessary for her to be cautious. they would find themselves in difficulties, she speculated; but, at this point, which was not very far, after all, upon the road of caution, her foresight deserted her. she sought for some definite catastrophe into which they must inevitably plunge. but she could think of none. it seemed to her that these catastrophes were fictitious; life went on and on--life was different altogether from what people said. and not only was she at an end of her stock of caution, but it seemed suddenly altogether superfluous. surely if any one could take care of himself, ralph denham could; he had told her that he did not love her. and, further, she meditated, walking on beneath the beech-trees and swinging her umbrella, as in her thought she was accustomed to complete freedom, why should she perpetually apply so different a standard to her behavior in practice? why, she reflected, should there be this perpetual disparity between the thought and the action, between the life of solitude and the life of society, this astonishing precipice on one side of which the soul was active and in broad daylight, on the other side of which it was contemplative and dark as night? was it not possible to step from one to the other, erect, and without essential change? was this not the chance he offered her--the rare and wonderful chance of friendship? at any rate, she told denham, with a sigh in which he heard both impatience and relief, that she agreed; she thought him right; she would accept his terms of friendship.  "
Match 1749: " she said, "
Match 1750: "  in fact, these principles having been laid down, a great lightness of spirit showed itself in both of them. they were both convinced that something of profound importance had been settled, and could now give their attention to their tea and the gardens. they wandered in and out of glass-houses, saw lilies swimming in tanks, breathed in the scent of thousands of carnations, and compared their respective tastes in the matter of trees and lakes. while talking exclusively of what they saw, so that any one might have overheard them, they felt that the compact between them was made firmer and deeper by the number of people who passed them and suspected nothing of the kind. the question of ralph's cottage and future was not mentioned again.    chapter xxvi  although the old coaches, with their gay panels and the guard's horn, and the humors of the box and the vicissitudes of the road, have long moldered into dust so far as they were matter, and are preserved in the printed pages of our novelists so far as they partook of the spirit, a journey to london by express train can still be a very pleasant and romantic adventure. cassandra otway, at the age of twenty-two, could imagine few things more pleasant. satiated with months of green fields as she was, the first row of artisans' villas on the outskirts of london seemed to have something serious about it, which positively increased the importance of every person in the railway carriage, and even, to her impressionable mind, quickened the speed of the train and gave a note of stern authority to the shriek of the engine-whistle. they were bound for london; they must have precedence of all traffic not similarly destined. a different demeanor was necessary directly one stepped out upon liverpool street platform, and became one of those preoccupied and hasty citizens for whose needs innumerable taxi-cabs, motor-omnibuses, and underground railways were in waiting. she did her best to look dignified and preoccupied too, but as the cab carried her away, with a determination which alarmed her a little, she became more and more forgetful of her station as a citizen of london, and turned her head from one window to another, picking up eagerly a building on this side or a street scene on that to feed her intense curiosity. and yet, while the drive lasted no one was real, nothing was ordinary; the crowds, the government buildings, the tide of men and women washing the base of the great glass windows, were all generalized, and affected her as if she saw them on the stage.  all these feelings were sustained and partly inspired by the fact that her journey took her straight to the center of her most romantic world. a thousand times in the midst of her pastoral landscape her thoughts took this precise road, were admitted to the house in chelsea, and went directly upstairs to katharine's room, where, invisible themselves, they had the better chance of feasting upon the privacy of the room's adorable and mysterious mistress. cassandra adored her cousin; the adoration might have been foolish, but was saved from that excess and lent an engaging charm by the volatile nature of cassandra's temperament. she had adored a great many things and people in the course of twenty-two years; she had been alternately the pride and the desperation of her teachers. she had worshipped architecture and music, natural history and humanity, literature and art, but always at the height of her enthusiasm, which was accompanied by a brilliant degree of accomplishment, she changed her mind and bought, surreptitiously, another grammar. the terrible results which governesses had predicted from such mental dissipation were certainly apparent now that cassandra was twenty-two, and had never passed an examination, and daily showed herself less and less capable of passing one. the more serious prediction that she could never possibly earn her living was also verified. but from all these short strands of different accomplishments cassandra wove for herself an attitude, a cast of mind, which, if useless, was found by some people to have the not despicable virtues of vivacity and freshness. katharine, for example, thought her a most charming companion. the cousins seemed to assemble between them a great range of qualities which are never found united in one person and seldom in half a dozen people. where katharine was simple, cassandra was complex; where katharine was solid and direct, cassandra was vague and evasive. in short, they represented very well the manly and the womanly sides of the feminine nature, and, for foundation, there was the profound unity of common blood between them. if cassandra adored katharine she was incapable of adoring any one without refreshing her spirit with frequent draughts of raillery and criticism, and katharine enjoyed her laughter at least as much as her respect.  respect was certainly uppermost in cassandra's mind at the present moment. katharine's engagement had appealed to her imagination as the first engagement in a circle of contemporaries is apt to appeal to the imaginations of the others; it was solemn, beautiful, and mysterious; it gave both parties the important air of those who have been initiated into some rite which is still concealed from the rest of the group. for katharine's sake cassandra thought william a most distinguished and interesting character, and welcomed first his conversation and then his manuscript as the marks of a friendship which it flattered and delighted her to inspire.  katharine was still out when she arrived at cheyne walk. after greeting her uncle and aunt and receiving, as usual, a present of two sovereigns for "
Match 1751: " from uncle trevor, whose favorite niece she was, she changed her dress and wandered into katharine's room to await her. what a great looking-glass katharine had, she thought, and how mature all the arrangements upon the dressing-table were compared to what she was used to at home. glancing round, she thought that the bills stuck upon a skewer and stood for ornament upon the mantelpiece were astonishingly like katharine, there wasn't a photograph of william anywhere to be seen. the room, with its combination of luxury and bareness, its silk dressing-gowns and crimson slippers, its shabby carpet and bare walls, had a powerful air of katharine herself; she stood in the middle of the room and enjoyed the sensation; and then, with a desire to finger what her cousin was in the habit of fingering, cassandra began to take down the books which stood in a row upon the shelf above the bed. in most houses this shelf is the ledge upon which the last relics of religious belief lodge themselves as if, late at night, in the heart of privacy, people, skeptical by day, find solace in sipping one draught of the old charm for such sorrows or perplexities as may steal from their hiding-places in the dark. but there was no hymn-book here. by their battered covers and enigmatical contents, cassandra judged them to be old school-books belonging to uncle trevor, and piously, though eccentrically, preserved by his daughter. there was no end, she thought, to the unexpectedness of katharine. she had once had a passion for geometry herself, and, curled upon katharine's quilt, she became absorbed in trying to remember how far she had forgotten what she once knew. katharine, coming in a little later, found her deep in this characteristic pursuit.  "
Match 1752: " cassandra exclaimed, shaking the book at her cousin, "
Match 1753: "  whose name, what book, which life was changed katharine proceeded to ascertain. she began to lay aside her clothes hurriedly, for she was very late.  "
Match 1754: " cassandra asked, shutting up her book. "
Match 1755: "  "
Match 1756: " said katharine, half turning in the midst of her operations, and looking at cassandra, who sat, clasping her knees, on the edge of the bed.  "
Match 1757: " she said, taking in the effect of cassandra from a new point of view. after an interval, the distinction, the irregular charm, of the small face with its long tapering nose and its bright oval eyes were very notable. the hair rose up off the forehead rather stiffly, and, given a more careful treatment by hairdressers and dressmakers, the light angular figure might possess a likeness to a french lady of distinction in the eighteenth century.  "
Match 1758: " cassandra asked, anticipating further possibilities of rapture.  "
Match 1759: "  "
Match 1760: "  "
Match 1761: "  "
Match 1762: " cassandra asserted.  "
Match 1763: "  "
Match 1764: "  katharine smiled.  "
Match 1765: "  she spoke disconnectedly, handling brush and comb, and pulling out the little drawers in her dressing-table and leaving them open. cassandra, sitting on the bed behind her, saw the reflection of her cousin's face in the looking-glass. the face in the looking-glass was serious and intent, apparently occupied with other things besides the straightness of the parting which, however, was being driven as straight as a roman road through the dark hair. cassandra was impressed again by katharine's maturity; and, as she enveloped herself in the blue dress which filled almost the whole of the long looking-glass with blue light and made it the frame of a picture, holding not only the slightly moving effigy of the beautiful woman, but shapes and colors of objects reflected from the background, cassandra thought that no sight had ever been quite so romantic. it was all in keeping with the room and the house, and the city round them; for her ears had not yet ceased to notice the hum of distant wheels.  they went downstairs rather late, in spite of katharine's extreme speed in getting ready. to cassandra's ears the buzz of voices inside the drawing-room was like the tuning up of the instruments of the orchestra. it seemed to her that there were numbers of people in the room, and that they were strangers, and that they were beautiful and dressed with the greatest distinction, although they proved to be mostly her relations, and the distinction of their clothing was confined, in the eyes of an impartial observer, to the white waistcoat which rodney wore. but they all rose simultaneously, which was by itself impressive, and they all exclaimed, and shook hands, and she was introduced to mr. peyton, and the door sprang open, and dinner was announced, and they filed off, william rodney offering her his slightly bent black arm, as she had secretly hoped he would. in short, had the scene been looked at only through her eyes, it must have been described as one of magical brilliancy. the pattern of the soup-plates, the stiff folds of the napkins, which rose by the side of each plate in the shape of arum lilies, the long sticks of bread tied with pink ribbon, the silver dishes and the sea-colored champagne glasses, with the flakes of gold congealed in their stems--all these details, together with a curiously pervasive smell of kid gloves, contributed to her exhilaration, which must be repressed, however, because she was grown up, and the world held no more for her to marvel at.  the world held no more for her to marvel at, it is true; but it held other people; and each other person possessed in cassandra's mind some fragment of what privately she called "
Match 1766: " it was a gift that they would impart if you asked them for it, and thus no dinner-party could possibly be dull, and little mr. peyton on her right and william rodney on her left were in equal measure endowed with the quality which seemed to her so unmistakable and so precious that the way people neglected to demand it was a constant source of surprise to her. she scarcely knew, indeed, whether she was talking to mr. peyton or to william rodney. but to one who, by degrees, assumed the shape of an elderly man with a mustache, she described how she had arrived in london that very afternoon, and how she had taken a cab and driven through the streets. mr. peyton, an editor of fifty years, bowed his bald head repeatedly, with apparent understanding. at least, he understood that she was very young and pretty, and saw that she was excited, though he could not gather at once from her words or remember from his own experience what there was to be excited about. "
Match 1767: " he asked. "
Match 1768: "  he was cut short in these amiable inquiries by her desire to know whether he was one of those who read, or one of those who look out of the window? mr. peyton was by no means sure which he did. he rather thought he did both. he was told that he had made a most dangerous confession. she could deduce his entire history from that one fact. he challenged her to proceed; and she proclaimed him a liberal member of parliament.  william, nominally engaged in a desultory conversation with aunt eleanor, heard every word, and taking advantage of the fact that elderly ladies have little continuity of conversation, at least with those whom they esteem for their youth and their sex, he asserted his presence by a very nervous laugh.  cassandra turned to him directly. she was enchanted to find that, instantly and with such ease, another of these fascinating beings was offering untold wealth for her extraction.  "
Match 1769: " she said, making use in her pleasure of his first name. "
Match 1770: "  "
Match 1771: " mr. peyton asked.  "
Match 1772: " said cassandra. "
Match 1773: " she went on, disregarding mr. peyton in a shameless way. "
Match 1774: "  william inclined his head and tried to conceal the pleasure that her remark gave him. but the pleasure was not unalloyed. however susceptible to flattery william might be, he would never tolerate it from people who showed a gross or emotional taste in literature, and if cassandra erred even slightly from what he considered essential in this respect he would express his discomfort by flinging out his hands and wrinkling his forehead; he would find no pleasure in her flattery after that.  "
Match 1775: " she proceeded, "
Match 1776: "  "
Match 1777: "  "
Match 1778: " she insisted, "
Match 1779: "  "
Match 1780: " rodney exclaimed. "
Match 1781: "  from this point they proceeded to go over, as far as memory served them, the different aspects of rodney's drama. she said nothing that jarred upon him, and untrained daring had the power to stimulate experience to such an extent that rodney was frequently seen to hold his fork suspended before him, while he debated the first principles of the art. mrs. hilbery thought to herself that she had never seen him to such advantage; yes, he was somehow different; he reminded her of some one who was dead, some one who was distinguished--she had forgotten his name.  cassandra's voice rose high in its excitement.  "
Match 1782: " she exclaimed.  "
Match 1783: " william replied, a little testily.  "
Match 1784: " she echoed, in a tone of derision.  "
Match 1785: "  "
Match 1786: " boomed uncle aubrey from across the table. "
Match 1787: "  the old gentleman had ruled a large part of the indian empire, but he was in the habit of saying that he had rather have written the works of dickens. the table now took possession of a subject much to its liking. aunt eleanor showed premonitory signs of pronouncing an opinion. although she had blunted her taste upon some form of philanthropy for twenty-five years, she had a fine natural instinct for an upstart or a pretender, and knew to a hairbreadth what literature should be and what it should not be. she was born to the knowledge, and scarcely thought it a matter to be proud of.  "
Match 1788: " she announced positively.  "
Match 1789: " mr. hilbery interposed, in his leisurely, half-humorous tones.  "
Match 1790: " said aunt eleanor, as if she had special authority from shakespeare to say so. "
Match 1791: " for, as there was a minister of literature present in the person of the editor of an esteemed review, she deferred to him.  mr. peyton leant a little back in his chair, and, putting his head rather on one side, observed that that was a question that he had never been able to answer entirely to his satisfaction. there was much to be said on both sides, but as he considered upon which side he should say it, mrs. hilbery broke in upon his judicious meditations.  "
Match 1792: " she exclaimed. "
Match 1793: " she looked about her as if these presences had suddenly manifested themselves round her dining-room table.  "
Match 1794: " aunt eleanor demanded, addressing herself naturally to katharine.  "
Match 1795: " said mrs. hilbery. "
Match 1796: " she remarked, with an affectionate glance at her daughter, who looked, she thought, a little sad. "
Match 1797: " she wound up, laying down her napkin and pushing her chair back. "
Match 1798: "  upstairs in the drawing-room cassandra found fresh sources of pleasure, first in the distinguished and expectant look of the room, and then in the chance of exercising her divining-rod upon a new assortment of human beings. but the low tones of the women, their meditative silences, the beauty which, to her at least, shone even from black satin and the knobs of amber which encircled elderly necks, changed her wish to chatter to a more subdued desire merely to watch and to whisper. she entered with delight into an atmosphere in which private matters were being interchanged freely, almost in monosyllables, by the older women who now accepted her as one of themselves. her expression became very gentle and sympathetic, as if she, too, were full of solicitude for the world which was somehow being cared for, managed and deprecated by aunt maggie and aunt eleanor. after a time she perceived that katharine was outside the community in some way, and, suddenly, she threw aside her wisdom and gentleness and concern and began to laugh.  "
Match 1799: " katharine asked.  a joke so foolish and unfilial wasn't worth explaining.  "
Match 1800: " katharine half shut her eyes and looked, but she looked in the wrong direction, and cassandra laughed more than ever, and was still laughing and doing her best to explain in a whisper that aunt eleanor, through half-shut eyes, was like the parrot in the cage at stogdon house, when the gentlemen came in and rodney walked straight up to them and wanted to know what they were laughing at.  "
Match 1801: " cassandra replied, standing up straight, clasping her hands in front of her, and facing him. her mockery was delicious to him. he had not even for a second the fear that she had been laughing at him. she was laughing because life was so adorable, so enchanting.  "
Match 1802: " he replied, drawing his feet together and pressing his finger-tips upon an imaginary opera-hat or malacca cane. "
Match 1803: "  "
Match 1804: " she cried. "
Match 1805: "  "
Match 1806: " she replied, "
Match 1807: "  her words, though spoken simply, produced a curious change in the light, sparkling atmosphere. william at once lost his look of animation and said seriously:  "
Match 1808: "  "
Match 1809: " said cassandra, almost severely.  "
Match 1810: " he corrected himself quickly.  "
Match 1811: " katharine went on. "
Match 1812: " she smiled at her as an elder sister might smile.  "
Match 1813: " cassandra exclaimed.  "
Match 1814: " rodney interposed. "
Match 1815: "  "
Match 1816: " said katharine. "
Match 1817: "  "
Match 1818: " cassandra added.  "
Match 1819: " katharine remarked, and turning her head as though she saw something that needed her attention in a far corner of the room, she left them.  for a moment they stood silent, after what seemed a deliberate introduction to each other, and cassandra watched her crossing the room.  "
Match 1820: " she said next moment, "
Match 1821: "  they sat down, and katharine, turning when she reached the window, saw william with his hand raised in gesticulation and his mouth open, as if ready to speak the moment cassandra ceased.  katharine's duty, whether it was to pull a curtain or move a chair, was either forgotten or discharged, but she continued to stand by the window without doing anything. the elderly people were all grouped together round the fire. they seemed an independent, middle-aged community busy with its own concerns. they were telling stories very well and listening to them very graciously. but for her there was no obvious employment.  "
Match 1822: " she thought, for in her slavery to her family traditions, she was ready to pay for her transgression with some plausible falsehood. she pushed aside the blind and looked at the river. but it was a dark night and the water was barely visible. cabs were passing, and couples were loitering slowly along the road, keeping as close to the railings as possible, though the trees had as yet no leaves to cast shadow upon their embraces. katharine, thus withdrawn, felt her loneliness. the evening had been one of pain, offering her, minute after minute, plainer proof that things would fall out as she had foreseen. she had faced tones, gestures, glances; she knew, with her back to them, that william, even now, was plunging deeper and deeper into the delight of unexpected understanding with cassandra. he had almost told her that he was finding it infinitely better than he could have believed. she looked out of the window, sternly determined to forget private misfortunes, to forget herself, to forget individual lives. with her eyes upon the dark sky, voices reached her from the room in which she was standing. she heard them as if they came from people in another world, a world antecedent to her world, a world that was the prelude, the antechamber to reality; it was as if, lately dead, she heard the living talking. the dream nature of our life had never been more apparent to her, never had life been more certainly an affair of four walls, whose objects existed only within the range of lights and fires, beyond which lay nothing, or nothing more than darkness. she seemed physically to have stepped beyond the region where the light of illusion still makes it desirable to possess, to love, to struggle. and yet her melancholy brought her no serenity. she still heard the voices within the room. she was still tormented by desires. she wished to be beyond their range. she wished inconsistently enough that she could find herself driving rapidly through the streets; she was even anxious to be with some one who, after a moment's groping, took a definite shape and solidified into the person of mary datchet. she drew the curtains so that the draperies met in deep folds in the middle of the window.  "
Match 1823: " said mr. hilbery, who was standing swaying affably from side to side, with his back to the fire. "
Match 1824: " he observed parenthetically, "
Match 1825: "  "
Match 1826: " katharine repeated. after all, one does not check children in their play, or rouse sleepers from their dreams. she passed william and cassandra on her way to the door.  "
Match 1827: " said william, speaking almost as if he were conscious of her against his will. "
Match 1828: " he rose, after a second's hesitation, and she understood that it cost him an effort. she knelt one knee upon the sofa where cassandra sat, looking down at her cousin's face, which still moved with the speed of what she had been saying.  "
Match 1829: " she asked.  "
Match 1830: " cassandra exclaimed, as if no further words were needed. "
Match 1831: " she exclaimed, "
Match 1832: " she added, looking at katharine, and as she looked her face lost its animation and became almost melancholy in sympathy with katharine's melancholy, which seemed to cassandra the last refinement of her distinction.  "
Match 1833: " said katharine darkly.  "
Match 1834: " she did not understand.  "
Match 1835: " cassandra looked at her with a puzzled expression.  "
Match 1836: " she said, as william returned to them. he had been quick. "
Match 1837: "  katharine perceived from his little frown and hesitation that he did not find that particular problem to his taste at present. she stood upright at once and said in a different tone:  "
Match 1838: "  "
Match 1839: " cassandra exclaimed.  "
Match 1840: " william demanded.  "
Match 1841: " she remarked, half turning her head towards him. she knew that he wished her to stay, not, indeed, with them, but in their neighborhood, in case of need.  "
Match 1842: " said william rather lamely, sitting down once more, as katharine left the room.  she was soon driving quickly, as she had wished to drive, through the lamp-lit streets. she liked both light and speed, and the sense of being out of doors alone, and the knowledge that she would reach mary in her high, lonely room at the end of the drive. she climbed the stone steps quickly, remarking the queer look of her blue silk skirt and blue shoes upon the stone, dusty with the boots of the day, under the light of an occasional jet of flickering gas.  the door was opened in a second by mary herself, whose face showed not only surprise at the sight of her visitor, but some degree of embarrassment. she greeted her cordially, and, as there was no time for explanations, katharine walked straight into the sitting-room, and found herself in the presence of a young man who was lying back in a chair and holding a sheet of paper in his hand, at which he was looking as if he expected to go on immediately with what he was in the middle of saying to mary datchet. the apparition of an unknown lady in full evening dress seemed to disturb him. he took his pipe from his mouth, rose stiffly, and sat down again with a jerk.  "
Match 1843: " mary asked.  "
Match 1844: " katharine inquired simultaneously.  the young man shook his head, as if he disowned his share in the question with some irritation.  "
Match 1845: " mary replied. "
Match 1846: "  mary had a ruffled appearance, as if she had been running her fingers through her hair in the course of her conversation; she was dressed more or less like a russian peasant girl. she sat down again in a chair which looked as if it had been her seat for some hours; the saucer which stood upon the arm contained the ashes of many cigarettes. mr. basnett, a very young man with a fresh complexion and a high forehead from which the hair was combed straight back, was one of that group of "
Match 1847: " suspected by mr. clacton, justly as it turned out, of an influence upon mary datchet. he had come down from one of the universities not long ago, and was now charged with the reformation of society. in connection with the rest of the group of very able young men he had drawn up a scheme for the education of labor, for the amalgamation of the middle class and the working class, and for a joint assault of the two bodies, combined in the society for the education of democracy, upon capital. the scheme had already reached the stage in which it was permissible to hire an office and engage a secretary, and he had been deputed to expound the scheme to mary, and make her an offer of the secretaryship, to which, as a matter of principle, a small salary was attached. since seven o'clock that evening he had been reading out loud the document in which the faith of the new reformers was expounded, but the reading was so frequently interrupted by discussion, and it was so often necessary to inform mary "
Match 1848: " of the private characters and evil designs of certain individuals and societies that they were still only half-way through the manuscript. neither of them realized that the talk had already lasted three hours. in their absorption they had forgotten even to feed the fire, and yet both mr. basnett in his exposition, and mary in her interrogation, carefully preserved a kind of formality calculated to check the desire of the human mind for irrelevant discussion. her questions frequently began, "
Match 1849: " and his replies invariably represented the views of some one called "
Match 1850: "  by this time mary was almost persuaded that she, too, was included in the "
Match 1851: " and agreed with mr. basnett in believing that "
Match 1852: " views, "
Match 1853: " society, "
Match 1854: " policy, stood for something quite definitely segregated from the main body of society in a circle of superior illumination.  the appearance of katharine in this atmosphere was extremely incongruous, and had the effect of making mary remember all sorts of things that she had been glad to forget.  "
Match 1855: " she asked again, looking, with a little smile, at the blue silk and the pearl-sewn shoes.  "
Match 1856: " katharine hazarded, rather hesitatingly, looking at the papers.  "
Match 1857: " mr. basnett replied. he said no more.  "
Match 1858: " mary explained.  "
Match 1859: "  "
Match 1860: " said mary.  "
Match 1861: " said mr. basnett, conveying the impression that, in his opinion, no sensible person could be afraid of liking to work.  "
Match 1862: " said katharine, as if he had stated this opinion aloud. "
Match 1863: "  "
Match 1864: " said mr. basnett, looking at her for the first time rather keenly, and refilling his pipe.  "
Match 1865: " said mary. "
Match 1866: "  "
Match 1867: " said mr. basnett. "
Match 1868: " he glanced at his document, rolled it into a cylinder between his fingers, and gazed into the fire. katharine felt that in this company anything that one said would be judged upon its merits; one had only to say what one thought, rather barely and tersely, with a curious assumption that the number of things that could properly be thought about was strictly limited. and mr. basnett was only stiff upon the surface; there was an intelligence in his face which attracted her intelligence.  "
Match 1869: " she asked.  "
Match 1870: " mr. basnett asked, with a little smile.  "
Match 1871: " said mary. the conspirators looked pleased, as if katharine's question, with the belief in their existence which it implied, had a warming effect upon them.  "
Match 1872: " mr. basnett began, with a little jerk of his head, "
Match 1873: "  "
Match 1874: " said mary thoughtfully.  "
Match 1875: " said mr. basnett, jerking his head in mary's direction. "
Match 1876: " he asked katharine, with a queer mixture of distrust and deference.  "
Match 1877: " mary replied for her.  "
Match 1878: " said mr. basnett. he made allowances for that; he and his friends had faced the question of sex, along with all others, and assigned it an honorable place in their scheme of life. katharine felt this beneath the roughness of his manner; and a world entrusted to the guardianship of mary datchet and mr. basnett seemed to her a good world, although not a romantic or beautiful place or, to put it figuratively, a place where any line of blue mist softly linked tree to tree upon the horizon. for a moment she thought she saw in his face, bent now over the fire, the features of that original man whom we still recall every now and then, although we know only the clerk, barrister, governmental official, or workingman variety of him. not that mr. basnett, giving his days to commerce and his spare time to social reform, would long carry about him any trace of his possibilities of completeness; but, for the moment, in his youth and ardor, still speculative, still uncramped, one might imagine him the citizen of a nobler state than ours. katharine turned over her small stock of information, and wondered what their society might be going to attempt. then she remembered that she was hindering their business, and rose, still thinking of this society, and thus thinking, she said to mr. basnett:  "
Match 1879: "  he nodded, and took his pipe from his mouth, but, being unable to think of anything to say, he put it back again, although he would have been glad if she had stayed.  against her wish, mary insisted upon taking her downstairs, and then, as there was no cab to be seen, they stood in the street together, looking about them.  "
Match 1880: " katharine urged her, thinking of mr. basnett with his papers in his hand.  "
Match 1881: " said mary, but the desire to find a cab was not her true reason for standing beside katharine for a minute or two. unfortunately for her composure, mr. basnett and his papers seemed to her an incidental diversion of life's serious purpose compared with some tremendous fact which manifested itself as she stood alone with katharine. it may have been their common womanhood.  "
Match 1882: " she asked suddenly, without preface.  "
Match 1883: " said katharine directly, but she did not remember when or where she had seen him. it took her a moment or two to remember why mary should ask her if she had seen ralph.  "
Match 1884: " said mary.  "
Match 1885: " said katharine, rather distractedly, taking her arm and beginning to walk up the street in the direction of the main road. "
Match 1886: " mary was silent, in the hope that katharine would tell her more. but katharine said nothing.  "
Match 1887: " mary exclaimed, her anger rising, to her own surprise. "
Match 1888: " she stopped. "
Match 1889: " she concluded.  "
Match 1890: " katharine observed. without either of them wishing it, a feeling of hostility had risen between them.  "
Match 1891: " said mary, after a pause.  "
Match 1892: " katharine asked.  "
Match 1893: " mary demanded rashly and foolishly.  "
Match 1894: "  "
Match 1895: " said mary.  "
Match 1896: " katharine asked. "
Match 1897: "  "
Match 1898: " said mary, controlling herself.  "
Match 1899: " said katharine suddenly.  "
Match 1900: "  "
Match 1901: " said katharine, peremptorily. "
Match 1902: " she spoke with unnecessary vehemence, but it was not directed against mary datchet. their animosity had completely disappeared, and upon both of them a cloud of difficulty and darkness rested, obscuring the future, in which they had both to find a way.  "
Match 1903: " katharine repeated. "
Match 1904: " she added, "
Match 1905: " they had reached the main thoroughfare, and stood looking at the omnibuses and passers-by, who seemed, for the moment, to illustrate what katharine had said of the diversity of human interests. for both of them it had become one of those moments of extreme detachment, when it seems unnecessary ever again to shoulder the burden of happiness and self-assertive existence. their neighbors were welcome to their possessions.  "
Match 1906: "' said mary, recovering herself first, as they turned after a long pause of this description. "
Match 1907: " she added, "
Match 1908: "  at the same time she was profoundly perplexed, not only by what she knew of the arrangements for katharine's marriage, but by the impression which she had of her, there on her arm, dark and inscrutable.  they walked back again and reached the steps which led up to mary's flat. here they stopped and paused for a moment, saying nothing.  "
Match 1909: " said katharine, rousing herself. "
Match 1910: " she glanced up at the lighted window near the top of the house, and they both looked at it and waited for a moment. a flight of semicircular steps ran up to the hall, and mary slowly mounted the first two or three, and paused, looking down upon katharine.  "
Match 1911: " she said slowly, and a little awkwardly. she climbed another step and looked down once more upon the figure that was only partly lit up, standing in the street with a colorless face turned upwards. as mary hesitated, a cab came by and katharine turned and stopped it, saying as she opened the door:  "
Match 1912: " she added, having to raise her voice a little, and shutting the door upon the rest of her words.  mary mounted the stairs step by step, as if she had to lift her body up an extremely steep ascent. she had had to wrench herself forcibly away from katharine, and every step vanquished her desire. she held on grimly, encouraging herself as though she were actually making some great physical effort in climbing a height. she was conscious that mr. basnett, sitting at the top of the stairs with his documents, offered her solid footing if she were capable of reaching it. the knowledge gave her a faint sense of exaltation.  mr. basnett raised his eyes as she opened the door.

Match 1913: " he said. "
Match 1914: "  he had been re-reading the document, and making pencil notes in the margin while he waited, and he went on again as if there had been no interruption. mary sat down among the flat cushions, lit another cigarette, and listened with a frown upon her face.  katharine leant back in the corner of the cab that carried her to chelsea, conscious of fatigue, and conscious, too, of the sober and satisfactory nature of such industry as she had just witnessed. the thought of it composed and calmed her. when she reached home she let herself in as quietly as she could, in the hope that the household was already gone to bed. but her excursion had occupied less time than she thought, and she heard sounds of unmistakable liveliness upstairs. a door opened, and she drew herself into a ground-floor room in case the sound meant that mr. peyton were taking his leave. from where she stood she could see the stairs, though she was herself invisible. some one was coming down the stairs, and now she saw that it was william rodney. he looked a little strange, as if he were walking in his sleep; his lips moved as if he were acting some part to himself. he came down very slowly, step by step, with one hand upon the banisters to guide himself. she thought he looked as if he were in some mood of high exaltation, which it made her uncomfortable to witness any longer unseen. she stepped into the hall. he gave a great start upon seeing her and stopped.  "
Match 1915: " he exclaimed. "
Match 1916: " he asked.  "
Match 1917: "  he did not answer, and walked into the ground-floor room through the door which stood open.  "
Match 1918: " he said, "
Match 1919: "  he was scarcely addressing her, and she said nothing. for a moment they stood at opposite sides of a table saying nothing. then he asked her quickly, "
Match 1920: "  before she could answer a door opened on the landing above and disturbed them. it disturbed william excessively. he started back, walked rapidly into the hall, and said in a loud and ostentatiously ordinary tone:  "
Match 1921: "  next moment he was gone. she went upstairs and found cassandra on the landing. she held two or three books in her hand, and she was stooping to look at others in a little bookcase. she said that she could never tell which book she wanted to read in bed, poetry, biography, or metaphysics.  "
Match 1922: " she asked, as they walked upstairs side by side.  "
Match 1923: " said katharine vaguely. cassandra looked at her.  "
Match 1924: " she said. "
Match 1925: "  "
Match 1926: " katharine asked.  "
Match 1927: " cassandra replied. "
Match 1928: " she added, looking with shy devotion at her cousin's beautiful face.    chapter xxvii  london, in the first days of spring, has buds that open and flowers that suddenly shake their petals--white, purple, or crimson--in competition with the display in the garden beds, although these city flowers are merely so many doors flung wide in bond street and the neighborhood, inviting you to look at a picture, or hear a symphony, or merely crowd and crush yourself among all sorts of vocal, excitable, brightly colored human beings. but, all the same, it is no mean rival to the quieter process of vegetable florescence. whether or not there is a generous motive at the root, a desire to share and impart, or whether the animation is purely that of insensate fervor and friction, the effect, while it lasts, certainly encourages those who are young, and those who are ignorant, to think the world one great bazaar, with banners fluttering and divans heaped with spoils from every quarter of the globe for their delight.  as cassandra otway went about london provided with shillings that opened turnstiles, or more often with large white cards that disregarded turnstiles, the city seemed to her the most lavish and hospitable of hosts. after visiting the national gallery, or hertford house, or hearing brahms or beethoven at the bechstein hall, she would come back to find a new person awaiting her, in whose soul were imbedded some grains of the invaluable substance which she still called reality, and still believed that she could find. the hilberys, as the saying is, "
Match 1929: " and that arrogant claim was certainly upheld by the number of houses which, within a certain area, lit their lamps at night, opened their doors after 3 p. m., and admitted the hilberys to their dining-rooms, say, once a month. an indefinable freedom and authority of manner, shared by most of the people who lived in these houses, seemed to indicate that whether it was a question of art, music, or government, they were well within the gates, and could smile indulgently at the vast mass of humanity which is forced to wait and struggle, and pay for entrance with common coin at the door. the gates opened instantly to admit cassandra. she was naturally critical of what went on inside, and inclined to quote what henry would have said; but she often succeeded in contradicting henry, in his absence, and invariably paid her partner at dinner, or the kind old lady who remembered her grandmother, the compliment of believing that there was meaning in what they said. for the sake of the light in her eager eyes, much crudity of expression and some untidiness of person were forgiven her. it was generally felt that, given a year or two of experience, introduced to good dressmakers, and preserved from bad influences, she would be an acquisition. those elderly ladies, who sit on the edge of ballrooms sampling the stuff of humanity between finger and thumb and breathing so evenly that the necklaces, which rise and fall upon their breasts, seem to represent some elemental force, such as the waves upon the ocean of humanity, concluded, a little smilingly, that she would do. they meant that she would in all probability marry some young man whose mother they respected.  william rodney was fertile in suggestions. he knew of little galleries, and select concerts, and private performances, and somehow made time to meet katharine and cassandra, and to give them tea or dinner or supper in his rooms afterwards. each one of her fourteen days thus promised to bear some bright illumination in its sober text. but sunday approached. the day is usually dedicated to nature. the weather was almost kindly enough for an expedition. but cassandra rejected hampton court, greenwich, richmond, and kew in favor of the zoological gardens. she had once trifled with the psychology of animals, and still knew something about inherited characteristics. on sunday afternoon, therefore, katharine, cassandra, and william rodney drove off to the zoo. as their cab approached the entrance, katharine bent forward and waved her hand to a young man who was walking rapidly in the same direction.  "
Match 1930: " she exclaimed. "
Match 1931: " she added. she had even come provided with a ticket for him. william's objection that he would not be admitted was, therefore, silenced directly. but the way in which the two men greeted each other was significant of what was going to happen. as soon as they had admired the little birds in the large cage william and cassandra lagged behind, and ralph and katharine pressed on rather in advance. it was an arrangement in which william took his part, and one that suited his convenience, but he was annoyed all the same. he thought that katharine should have told him that she had invited denham to meet them.  "
Match 1932: " he said rather sharply. it was clear that he was irritated, and cassandra felt for his annoyance. they were standing by the pen of some oriental hog, and she was prodding the brute gently with the point of her umbrella, when a thousand little observations seemed, in some way, to collect in one center. the center was one of intense and curious emotion. were they happy? she dismissed the question as she asked it, scorning herself for applying such simple measures to the rare and splendid emotions of so unique a couple. nevertheless, her manner became immediately different, as if, for the first time, she felt consciously womanly, and as if william might conceivably wish later on to confide in her. she forgot all about the psychology of animals, and the recurrence of blue eyes and brown, and became instantly engrossed in her feelings as a woman who could administer consolation, and she hoped that katharine would keep ahead with mr. denham, as a child who plays at being grown-up hopes that her mother won't come in just yet, and spoil the game. or was it not rather that she had ceased to play at being grown-up, and was conscious, suddenly, that she was alarmingly mature and in earnest?  there was still unbroken silence between katharine and ralph denham, but the occupants of the different cages served instead of speech.  "
Match 1933: " ralph asked at length.  "
Match 1934: " she pondered. "
Match 1935: " she speculated, stopping before a gray bear, who was philosophically playing with a tassel which once, perhaps, formed part of a lady's parasol.  "
Match 1936: " ralph remarked.  "
Match 1937: " she replied. the detachment expressed by her voice puzzled ralph, and he would have been glad if she had explained her meaning further. but he was not going to press her for explanations. each moment was to be, as far as he could make it, complete in itself, owing nothing of its happiness to explanations, borrowing neither bright nor dark tints from the future.  "
Match 1938: " he remarked. "
Match 1939: " they walked to the counter piled with little paper bags, and each simultaneously produced a shilling and pressed it upon the young lady, who did not know whether to oblige the lady or the gentleman, but decided, from conventional reasons, that it was the part of the gentleman to pay.  "
Match 1940: " said ralph peremptorily, refusing the coin which katharine tendered. "
Match 1941: " he added, seeing her smile at his tone of decision.  "
Match 1942: " she agreed, breaking the bun into parts and tossing them down the bears' throats, "
Match 1943: "  he refused to tell her. he could not explain to her that he was offering up consciously all his happiness to her, and wished, absurdly enough, to pour every possession he had upon the blazing pyre, even his silver and gold. he wished to keep this distance between them--the distance which separates the devotee from the image in the shrine.  circumstances conspired to make this easier than it would have been, had they been seated in a drawing-room, for example, with a tea-tray between them. he saw her against a background of pale grottos and sleek hides; camels slanted their heavy-ridded eyes at her, giraffes fastidiously observed her from their melancholy eminence, and the pink-lined trunks of elephants cautiously abstracted buns from her outstretched hands. then there were the hothouses. he saw her bending over pythons coiled upon the sand, or considering the brown rock breaking the stagnant water of the alligators' pool, or searching some minute section of tropical forest for the golden eye of a lizard or the indrawn movement of the green frogs' flanks. in particular, he saw her outlined against the deep green waters, in which squadrons of silvery fish wheeled incessantly, or ogled her for a moment, pressing their distorted mouths against the glass, quivering their tails straight out behind them. again, there was the insect house, where she lifted the blinds of the little cages, and marveled at the purple circles marked upon the rich tussore wings of some lately emerged and semi-conscious butterfly, or at caterpillars immobile like the knobbed twigs of a pale-skinned tree, or at slim green snakes stabbing the glass wall again and again with their flickering cleft tongues. the heat of the air, and the bloom of heavy flowers, which swam in water or rose stiffly from great red jars, together with the display of curious patterns and fantastic shapes, produced an atmosphere in which human beings tended to look pale and to fall silent.  opening the door of a house which rang with the mocking and profoundly unhappy laughter of monkeys, they discovered william and cassandra. william appeared to be tempting some small reluctant animal to descend from an upper perch to partake of half an apple. cassandra was reading out, in her high-pitched tones, an account of this creature's secluded disposition and nocturnal habits. she saw katharine and exclaimed:  "
Match 1944: "  "
Match 1945: " said william. he looked from one to the other, and seemed to take stock of denham's unfashionable appearance. he seemed to wish to find some outlet for malevolence, but, failing one, he remained silent. the glance, the slight quiver of the upper lip, were not lost upon katharine.  "
Match 1946: " she remarked. "
Match 1947: "  "
Match 1948: " said rodney, withdrawing his hand with the apple.  "
Match 1949: " denham replied.  "
Match 1950: " cassandra asked him, not from a genuine desire to visit the reptiles, but in obedience to her new-born feminine susceptibility, which urged her to charm and conciliate the other sex. denham began to give her directions, and katharine and william moved on together.  "
Match 1951: " william remarked.  "
Match 1952: " she replied.  "
Match 1953: " william returned, with superficial urbanity.  many retorts were obvious, but wishing, on the whole, for peace, katharine merely inquired:  "
Match 1954: "  "
Match 1955: " he replied. "
Match 1956: "  "
Match 1957: " she replied, turning her head to look for him. but he and cassandra were absorbed in the aye-aye once more.  william and katharine watched them for a moment, and each looked curiously at the object of the other's preference. but resting his eye upon cassandra, to whose elegance the dressmakers had now done justice, william said sharply:  "
Match 1958: "  "
Match 1959: " katharine replied.  they were professedly looking into the enormous central cage of monkeys, and being thoroughly annoyed by william, she compared him to a wretched misanthropical ape, huddled in a scrap of old shawl at the end of a pole, darting peevish glances of suspicion and distrust at his companions. her tolerance was deserting her. the events of the past week had worn it thin. she was in one of those moods, perhaps not uncommon with either sex, when the other becomes very clearly distinguished, and of contemptible baseness, so that the necessity of association is degrading, and the tie, which at such moments is always extremely close, drags like a halter round the neck. william's exacting demands and his jealousy had pulled her down into some horrible swamp of her nature where the primeval struggle between man and woman still rages.  "
Match 1960: " william persisted. "
Match 1961: " as he spoke he rattled his stick against the bars of the cage, which gave his words an accompaniment peculiarly exasperating to katharine's nerves.  "
Match 1962: " she said. "
Match 1963: "  "
Match 1964: " said william. by his determined rattling he had now collected the animated attention of some half-dozen apes. either to propitiate them, or to show his consideration for their feelings, he proceeded to offer them the apple which he held.  the sight, unfortunately, was so comically apt in its illustration of the picture in her mind, the ruse was so transparent, that katharine was seized with laughter. she laughed uncontrollably. william flushed red. no display of anger could have hurt his feelings more profoundly. it was not only that she was laughing at him; the detachment of the sound was horrible.  "
Match 1965: " he muttered, and, turning, found that the other couple had rejoined them. as if the matter had been privately agreed upon, the couples separated once more, katharine and denham passing out of the house without more than a perfunctory glance round them. denham obeyed what seemed to be katharine's wish in thus making haste. some change had come over her. he connected it with her laughter, and her few words in private with rodney; he felt that she had become unfriendly to him. she talked, but her remarks were indifferent, and when he spoke her attention seemed to wander. this change of mood was at first extremely disagreeable to him; but soon he found it salutary. the pale drizzling atmosphere of the day affected him, also. the charm, the insidious magic in which he had luxuriated, were suddenly gone; his feeling had become one of friendly respect, and to his great pleasure he found himself thinking spontaneously of the relief of finding himself alone in his room that night. in his surprise at the suddenness of the change, and at the extent of his freedom, he bethought him of a daring plan, by which the ghost of katharine could be more effectually exorcised than by mere abstinence. he would ask her to come home with him to tea. he would force her through the mill of family life; he would place her in a light unsparing and revealing. his family would find nothing to admire in her, and she, he felt certain, would despise them all, and this, too, would help him. he felt himself becoming more and more merciless towards her. by such courageous measures any one, he thought, could end the absurd passions which were the cause of so much pain and waste. he could foresee a time when his experiences, his discovery, and his triumph were made available for younger brothers who found themselves in the same predicament. he looked at his watch, and remarked that the gardens would soon be closed.  "
Match 1966: " he added, "
Match 1967: " he looked over his shoulder, and, seeing no trace of them, remarked at once:  "
Match 1968: "  "
Match 1969: " she asked.  "
Match 1970: " he replied promptly.  she assented, having very little notion whether highgate was next door to regent's park or not. she was only glad to put off her return to the family tea-table in chelsea for an hour or two. they proceeded with dogged determination through the winding roads of regent's park, and the sunday-stricken streets of the neighborhood, in the direction of the tube station. ignorant of the way, she resigned herself entirely to him, and found his silence a convenient cover beneath which to continue her anger with rodney.  when they stepped out of the train into the still grayer gloom of highgate, she wondered, for the first time, where he was taking her. had he a family, or did he live alone in rooms? on the whole she was inclined to believe that he was the only son of an aged, and possibly invalid, mother. she sketched lightly, upon the blank vista down which they walked, the little white house and the tremulous old lady rising from behind her tea-table to greet her with faltering words about "
Match 1971: " and was on the point of asking ralph to tell her what she might expect, when he jerked open one of the infinite number of identical wooden doors, and led her up a tiled path to a porch in the alpine style of architecture. as they listened to the shaking of the bell in the basement, she could summon no vision to replace the one so rudely destroyed.  "
Match 1972: " said ralph. "
Match 1973: "  "
Match 1974: " she asked, without concealing her dismay.  "
Match 1975: " he replied grimly, as the door opened.  while ralph took off his coat, she had time to notice the ferns and photographs and draperies, and to hear a hum, or rather a babble, of voices talking each other down, from the sound of them. the rigidity of extreme shyness came over her. she kept as far behind denham as she could, and walked stiffly after him into a room blazing with unshaded lights, which fell upon a number of people, of different ages, sitting round a large dining-room table untidily strewn with food, and unflinchingly lit up by incandescent gas. ralph walked straight to the far end of the table.  "
Match 1976: " he said.  a large elderly lady, bent over an unsatisfactory spirit-lamp, looked up with a little frown, and observed:  "
Match 1977: " she continued on the same breath, to catch the servant before she left the room, "
Match 1978: " she sighed, looking generally down the table, and then began seeking among the china before her for two clean cups for the new-comers.  the unsparing light revealed more ugliness than katharine had seen in one room for a very long time. it was the ugliness of enormous folds of brown material, looped and festooned, of plush curtains, from which depended balls and fringes, partially concealing bookshelves swollen with black school-texts. her eye was arrested by crossed scabbards of fretted wood upon the dull green wall, and whereever there was a high flat eminence, some fern waved from a pot of crinkled china, or a bronze horse reared so high that the stump of a tree had to sustain his forequarters. the waters of family life seemed to rise and close over her head, and she munched in silence.  at length mrs. denham looked up from her teacups and remarked:  "
Match 1979: "  a boy of sixteen, who appeared to be johnnie, grumbled derisively both at the notion of drawing-room tea and at the necessity of carrying a tray up to his brother. but he took himself off, being enjoined by his mother to mind what he was doing, and shut the door after him.  "
Match 1980: " said katharine, applying herself with determination to the dissection of her cake; they had given her too large a slice. she knew that mrs. denham suspected her of critical comparisons. she knew that she was making poor progress with her cake. mrs. denham had looked at her sufficiently often to make it clear to katharine that she was asking who this young woman was, and why ralph had brought her to tea with them. there was an obvious reason, which mrs. denham had probably reached by this time. outwardly, she was behaving with rather rusty and laborious civility. she was making conversation about the amenities of highgate, its development and situation.  "
Match 1981: " she said, "
Match 1982: "  "
Match 1983: " said katharine. mrs. denham agreed effusively, as if her opinion of katharine's sense had risen.  "
Match 1984: " she said, and she went on, as people who live in the suburbs so often do, to prove that it was healthier, more convenient, and less spoilt than any suburb round london. she spoke with such emphasis that it was quite obvious that she expressed unpopular views, and that her children disagreed with her.  "
Match 1985: " said hester, a girl of eighteen, abruptly.  "
Match 1986: " james muttered.  "
Match 1987: " said mrs. denham. "
Match 1988: " here some family joke exploded, which katharine could not follow. even mrs. denham laughed against her will.  "
Match 1989: " she added reprovingly. miss hilbery smiled and shook her head, and was conscious that a great many eyes rested upon her, for a moment, as if they would find pleasure in discussing her when she was gone. owing, perhaps, to this critical glance, katharine decided that ralph denham's family was commonplace, unshapely, lacking in charm, and fitly expressed by the hideous nature of their furniture and decorations. she glanced along a mantelpiece ranged with bronze chariots, silver vases, and china ornaments that were either facetious or eccentric.  she did not apply her judgment consciously to ralph, but when she looked at him, a moment later, she rated him lower than at any other time of their acquaintanceship.  he had made no effort to tide over the discomforts of her introduction, and now, engaged in argument with his brother, apparently forgot her presence. she must have counted upon his support more than she realized, for this indifference, emphasized, as it was, by the insignificant commonplace of his surroundings, awoke her, not only to that ugliness, but to her own folly. she thought of one scene after another in a few seconds, with that shudder which is almost a blush. she had believed him when he spoke of friendship. she had believed in a spiritual light burning steadily and steadfastly behind the erratic disorder and incoherence of life. the light was now gone out, suddenly, as if a sponge had blotted it. the litter of the table and the tedious but exacting conversation of mrs. denham remained: they struck, indeed, upon a mind bereft of all defences, and, keenly conscious of the degradation which is the result of strife whether victorious or not, she thought gloomily of her loneliness, of life's futility, of the barren prose of reality, of william rodney, of her mother, and the unfinished book.  her answers to mrs. denham were perfunctory to the verge of rudeness, and to ralph, who watched her narrowly, she seemed further away than was compatible with her physical closeness. he glanced at her, and ground out further steps in his argument, determined that no folly should remain when this experience was over. next moment, a silence, sudden and complete, descended upon them all. the silence of all these people round the untidy table was enormous and hideous; something horrible seemed about to burst from it, but they endured it obstinately. a second later the door opened and there was a stir of relief; cries of "
Match 1990: " broke up the oppressive concentration of so many eyes upon the table-cloth, and set the waters of family life dashing in brisk little waves again. it was obvious that joan had some mysterious and beneficent power upon her family. she went up to katharine as if she had heard of her, and was very glad to see her at last. she explained that she had been visiting an uncle who was ill, and that had kept her. no, she hadn't had any tea, but a slice of bread would do. some one handed up a hot cake, which had been keeping warm in the fender; she sat down by her mother's side, mrs. denham's anxieties seemed to relax, and every one began eating and drinking, as if tea had begun over again. hester voluntarily explained to katharine that she was reading to pass some examination, because she wanted more than anything in the whole world to go to newnham.  "
Match 1991: " johnnie demanded.  "
Match 1992: " said joan, overhearing him instantly. "
Match 1993: " she went on, smiling at katharine, with the worried humorous smile of the elder sister whose younger brothers and sisters have become almost like children of her own.  "
Match 1994: " ralph  asked.  "
Match 1995: "  "
Match 1996: " said mrs. denham, still cherishing the belief that the bread-knife could be spoilt. "
Match 1997: " she said, without any conviction that she would be obeyed. "
Match 1998: " she continued. "
Match 1999: " and in the mysterious delight of learning further details of these arrangements, and suggesting more sensible plans of her own, which, from the aggrieved way in which she spoke, she did not seem to expect any one to adopt, mrs. denham completely forgot the presence of a well-dressed visitor, who had to be informed about the amenities of highgate. as soon as joan had taken her seat, an argument had sprung up on either side of katharine, as to whether the salvation army has any right to play hymns at street corners on sunday mornings, thereby making it impossible for james to have his sleep out, and tampering with the rights of individual liberty.  "
Match 2000: " said johnnie, explaining himself to katharine, whereupon james fired up and, making her his goal, also exclaimed:  "
Match 2001: "  they appealed to her, and she forgot her cake and began to laugh and talk and argue with sudden animation. the large family seemed to her so warm and various that she forgot to censure them for their taste in pottery. but the personal question between james and johnnie merged into some argument already, apparently, debated, so that the parts had been distributed among the family, in which ralph took the lead; and katharine found herself opposed to him and the champion of johnnie's cause, who, it appeared, always lost his head and got excited in argument with ralph.  "
Match 2002: " he exclaimed, after katharine had restated his case, and made it more precise. the debate was left almost solely to katharine and ralph. they looked into each other's eyes fixedly, like wrestlers trying to see what movement is coming next, and while ralph spoke, katharine bit her lower lip, and was always ready with her next point as soon as he had done. they were very well matched, and held the opposite views.  but at the most exciting stage of the argument, for no reason that katharine could see, all chairs were pushed back, and one after another the denham family got up and went out of the door, as if a bell had summoned them. she was not used to the clockwork regulations of a large family. she hesitated in what she was saying, and rose. mrs. denham and joan had drawn together and stood by the fireplace, slightly raising their skirts above their ankles, and discussing something which had an air of being very serious and very private. they appeared to have forgotten her presence among them. ralph stood holding the door open for her.  "
Match 2003: " he said. and katharine, glancing back at joan, who smiled at her in a preoccupied way, followed ralph upstairs. she was thinking of their argument, and when, after the long climb, he opened his door, she began at once.  "
Match 2004: "  for some time they continued the argument, and then the intervals between one statement and the next became longer and longer, and they spoke more speculatively and less pugnaciously, and at last fell silent. katharine went over the argument in her mind, remembering how, now and then, it had been set conspicuously on the right course by some remark offered either by james or by johnnie.  "
Match 2005: " she said. "
Match 2006: "  "
Match 2007: " ralph replied. "
Match 2008: "  "
Match 2009: "  "
Match 2010: "  he was immensely pleased by katharine's praise of his brothers and sisters. he would have liked to go on telling her about them, but he checked himself.  "
Match 2011: " katharine continued. his deep pride in his family was more evident to him, at that moment, than ever before, and the idea of living alone in a cottage was ridiculous. all that brotherhood and sisterhood, and a common childhood in a common past mean, all the stability, the unambitious comradeship, and tacit understanding of family life at its best, came to his mind, and he thought of them as a company, of which he was the leader, bound on a difficult, dreary, but glorious voyage. and it was katharine who had opened his eyes to this, he thought.  a little dry chirp from the corner of the room now roused her attention.  "
Match 2012: " he explained briefly. "
Match 2013: " she looked at the rook, and her eyes went from one object to another.  "
Match 2014: " she said, her eyes resting upon his books. he said that he was in the habit of working there at night.  "
Match 2015: " he was extremely anxious that she should appreciate his view, and she rose to see what was to be seen. it was already dark enough for the turbulent haze to be yellow with the light of street lamps, and she tried to determine the quarters of the city beneath her. the sight of her gazing from his window gave him a peculiar satisfaction. when she turned, at length, he was still sitting motionless in his chair.  "
Match 2016: " she said. "
Match 2017: " she settled upon the arm of the chair irresolutely, thinking that she had no wish to go home. william would be there, and he would find some way of making things unpleasant for her, and the memory of their quarrel came back to her. she had noticed ralph's coldness, too. she looked at him, and from his fixed stare she thought that he must be working out some theory, some argument. he had thought, perhaps, of some fresh point in his position, as to the bounds of personal liberty. she waited, silently, thinking about liberty.  "
Match 2018: " he said at last, without moving.  "
Match 2019: " she repeated, thinking of the argument.  "
Match 2020: " he burst out.  "
Match 2021: "  "
Match 2022: " he stopped short.  "
Match 2023: "  "
Match 2024: "  an immense relief, and a reluctance to enjoy that relief, conflicted in her heart.  she slid down into the chair.  "
Match 2025: " she said.  "
Match 2026: " he replied. "
Match 2027: "  he spoke with such vehemence that her relief disappeared; she frowned; and her tone changed to one almost of severity.  "
Match 2028: " he looked at her. "
Match 2029: "  "
Match 2030: " he began, but she would not let him speak.  "

Match 2042: " he asked abruptly, with a change of tone.  "
Match 2043: "  "
Match 2044: " he said. "
Match 2045: " he hoped that she would go on with the subject. but she made no reply. he had done his best to master himself, and his voice was sufficiently indifferent, but her silence tormented him. she would never speak to him of rodney of her own accord, and her reserve left a whole continent of her soul in darkness.  "

Match 2062: " ralph added.  at this she smiled, but in another moment her smile faded, either because of his words or of the way in which he spoke them. she was capable of forgetting things. he saw that. but what more did he see? was he not looking at something she had never shown to anybody? was it not something so profound that the notion of his seeing it almost shocked her? her smile faded, and for a moment she seemed upon the point of speaking, but looking at him in silence, with a look that seemed to ask what she could not put into words, she turned and bade him good night.    chapter xxviii  like a strain of music, the effect of katharine's presence slowly died from the room in which ralph sat alone. the music had ceased in the rapture of its melody. he strained to catch the faintest lingering echoes; for a moment the memory lulled him into peace; but soon it failed, and he paced the room so hungry for the sound to come again that he was conscious of no other desire left in life. she had gone without speaking; abruptly a chasm had been cut in his course, down which the tide of his being plunged in disorder; fell upon rocks; flung itself to destruction. the distress had an effect of physical ruin and disaster. he trembled; he was white; he felt exhausted, as if by a great physical effort. he sank at last into a chair standing opposite her empty one, and marked, mechanically, with his eye upon the clock, how she went farther and farther from him, was home now, and now, doubtless, again with rodney. but it was long before he could realize these facts; the immense desire for her presence churned his senses into foam, into froth, into a haze of emotion that removed all facts from his grasp, and gave him a strange sense of distance, even from the material shapes of wall and window by which he was surrounded. the prospect of the future, now that the strength of his passion was revealed to him, appalled him.  the marriage would take place in september, she had said; that allowed him, then, six full months in which to undergo these terrible extremes of emotion. six months of torture, and after that the silence of the grave, the isolation of the insane, the exile of the damned; at best, a life from which the chief good was knowingly and for ever excluded. an impartial judge might have assured him that his chief hope of recovery lay in this mystic temper, which identified a living woman with much that no human beings long possess in the eyes of each other; she would pass, and the desire for her vanish, but his belief in what she stood for, detached from her, would remain. this line of thought offered, perhaps, some respite, and possessed of a brain that had its station considerably above the tumult of the senses, he tried to reduce the vague and wandering incoherency of his emotions to order. the sense of self-preservation was strong in him, and katharine herself had strangely revived it by convincing him that his family deserved and needed all his strength. she was right, and for their sake, if not for his own, this passion, which could bear no fruit, must be cut off, uprooted, shown to be as visionary and baseless as she had maintained. the best way of achieving this was not to run away from her, but to face her, and having steeped himself in her qualities, to convince his reason that they were, as she assured him, not those that he imagined. she was a practical woman, a domestic wife for an inferior poet, endowed with romantic beauty by some freak of unintelligent nature. no doubt her beauty itself would not stand examination. he had the means of settling this point at least. he possessed a book of photographs from the greek statues; the head of a goddess, if the lower part were concealed, had often given him the ecstasy of being in katharine's presence. he took it down from the shelf and found the picture. to this he added a note from her, bidding him meet her at the zoo. he had a flower which he had picked at kew to teach her botany. such were his relics. he placed them before him, and set himself to visualize her so clearly that no deception or delusion was possible. in a second he could see her, with the sun slanting across her dress, coming towards him down the green walk at kew. he made her sit upon the seat beside him. he heard her voice, so low and yet so decided in its tone; she spoke reasonably of indifferent matters. he could see her faults, and analyze her virtues. his pulse became quieter, and his brain increased in clarity. this time she could not escape him. the illusion of her presence became more and more complete. they seemed to pass in and out of each other's minds, questioning and answering. the utmost fullness of communion seemed to be theirs. thus united, he felt himself raised to an eminence, exalted, and filled with a power of achievement such as he had never known in singleness. once more he told over conscientiously her faults, both of face and character; they were clearly known to him; but they merged themselves in the flawless union that was born of their association. they surveyed life to its uttermost limits. how deep it was when looked at from this height! how sublime! how the commonest things moved him almost to tears! thus, he forgot the inevitable limitations; he forgot her absence, he thought it of no account whether she married him or another; nothing mattered, save that she should exist, and that he should love her. some words of these reflections were uttered aloud, and it happened that among them were the words, "
Match 2063: " it was the first time that he had used the word "
Match 2064: " to describe his feeling; madness, romance, hallucination--he had called it by these names before; but having, apparently by accident, stumbled upon the word "
Match 2065: " he repeated it again and again with a sense of revelation.  "
Match 2066: " he exclaimed, with something like dismay. he leant against the window-sill, looking over the city as she had looked. everything had become miraculously different and completely distinct. his feelings were justified and needed no further explanation. but he must impart them to some one, because his discovery was so important that it concerned other people too. shutting the book of greek photographs, and hiding his relics, he ran downstairs, snatched his coat, and passed out of doors.  the lamps were being lit, but the streets were dark enough and empty enough to let him walk his fastest, and to talk aloud as he walked. he had no doubt where he was going. he was going to find mary datchet. the desire to share what he felt, with some one who understood it, was so imperious that he did not question it. he was soon in her street. he ran up the stairs leading to her flat two steps at a time, and it never crossed his mind that she might not be at home. as he rang her bell, he seemed to himself to be announcing the presence of something wonderful that was separate from himself, and gave him power and authority over all other people. mary came to the door after a moment's pause. he was perfectly silent, and in the dusk his face looked completely white. he followed her into her room.  "
Match 2067: " she said, to his extreme surprise, for he had counted on finding her alone. a young man rose, and said that he knew ralph by sight.  "
Match 2068: " said mary. "
Match 2069: " she explained. "
Match 2070: "  the voice in which she gave this information was so constrained as to sound almost harsh.  "
Match 2071: " said ralph. he looked neither at mary nor at mr. basnett. mr. basnett thought he had seldom seen a more disagreeable or formidable man than this friend of mary's, this sarcastic-looking, white-faced mr. denham, who seemed to demand, as if by right, an account of their proposals, and to criticize them before he had heard them. nevertheless, he explained his projects as clearly as he could, and knew that he wished mr. denham to think well of them.  "
Match 2072: " said ralph, when he had done. "
Match 2073: " he suddenly remarked, "
Match 2074: " the look which he cast at her frightened her; it expressed mutely, perhaps without his own consciousness, something deep, wild, and passionate. she left the room at once. her heart beat fast at the knowledge of ralph's presence; but it beat with pain, and with an extraordinary fear. she stood listening for a moment to the voices in the next room.  "
Match 2075: " she heard ralph say, in this strange voice, to mr. basnett. "
Match 2076: "  mary returned with the quinine.  "
Match 2077: " mr. basnett inquired, pulling out his notebook and preparing to write. for twenty minutes, perhaps, he wrote down names, addresses, and other suggestions that ralph dictated to him. then, when ralph fell silent, mr. basnett felt that his presence was not desired, and thanking ralph for his help, with a sense that he was very young and ignorant compared with him, he said good-bye.  "
Match 2078: " said ralph, directly mr. basnett had shut the door and they were alone together. "
Match 2079: " he repeated. but the old difficulty of speaking to mary without reserve prevented him from continuing. his desire to proclaim his love for katharine was still strong in him, but he had felt, directly he saw mary, that he could not share it with her. the feeling increased as he sat talking to mr. basnett. and yet all the time he was thinking of katharine, and marveling at his love. the tone in which he spoke mary's name was harsh.  "
Match 2080: " she asked, startled by his tone. she looked at him anxiously, and her little frown showed that she was trying painfully to understand him, and was puzzled. he could feel her groping for his meaning, and he was annoyed with her, and thought how he had always found her slow, painstaking, and clumsy. he had behaved badly to her, too, which made his irritation the more acute. without waiting for him to answer, she rose as if his answer were indifferent to her, and began to put in order some papers that mr. basnett had left on the table. she hummed a scrap of a tune under her breath, and moved about the room as if she were occupied in making things tidy, and had no other concern.  "
Match 2081: " she said casually, returning to her seat.  "
Match 2082: " ralph replied. she did not press him further. they sat side by side without speaking, and mary reached her hand for her work basket, and took out her sewing and threaded a needle.  "
Match 2083: " ralph observed, referring to mr. basnett.  "
Match 2084: " she spoke in the most impersonal manner.  "
Match 2085: " ralph replied, with equal distance of manner.  "
Match 2086: " she observed. "
Match 2087: "  she went on sewing in silence.  "
Match 2088: " she said, looking up and seeing the tabloids upon the mantelpiece.  "
Match 2089: " said ralph shortly.  "
Match 2090: " she replied tranquilly.  "
Match 2091: " he exclaimed. "
Match 2092: "  "
Match 2093: " she replied.  "
Match 2094: " he spoke the word, but, as he spoke it, it seemed robbed of substance.  "
Match 2095: " she said quietly. "
Match 2096: "  "
Match 2097: "  he rose and began, as usual, to pace up and down the room. he knew that what he had just said bore very little resemblance to what he felt, for mary's presence acted upon him like a very strong magnet, drawing from him certain expressions which were not those he made use of when he spoke to himself, nor did they represent his deepest feelings. he felt a little contempt for himself at having spoken thus; but somehow he had been forced into speech.  "
Match 2098: " said mary suddenly. "
Match 2099: " she spoke with unusual irritability, and ralph, noticing it with surprise, sat down at once.  "
Match 2100: "  "
Match 2101: "  "
Match 2102: "  "
Match 2103: "  "
Match 2104: " said mary. but in truth the calm of his manner, now that he was sitting down once more, wrapt her in the presence of something which she felt to be so strong, so mysterious, so incalculable, that she scarcely dared to attempt to intercept it by any word or question that she was able to frame. she looked at ralph blankly, with a kind of awe in her face, her lips slightly parted, and her brows raised. he was apparently quite unconscious of her gaze. then, as if she could look no longer, she leant back in her chair, and half closed her eyes. the distance between them hurt her terribly; one thing after another came into her mind, tempting her to assail ralph with questions, to force him to confide in her, and to enjoy once more his intimacy. but she rejected every impulse, for she could not speak without doing violence to some reserve which had grown between them, putting them a little far from each other, so that he seemed to her dignified and remote, like a person she no longer knew well.  "
Match 2105: " she asked gently, and even with courtesy, at length.  "
Match 2106: " he, too, spoke very gently.  "
Match 2107: " she added.  "
Match 2108: " he shook his head. "
Match 2109: " she saw the effort with which he spoke katharine's name, and believed that he forced himself to make amends now for his concealment in the past. at any rate, she was conscious of no anger against him; but rather of a deep pity for one condemned to suffer as she had suffered. but in the case of katharine it was different; she was indignant with katharine.  "
Match 2110: " she said, a little aggressively.  ralph moved directly.  "
Match 2111: " he asked.  "
Match 2112: " she replied. "
Match 2113: "  "
Match 2114: " he hesitated.  "
Match 2115: " she returned. "
Match 2116: " she stopped, but forced herself to go on. "
Match 2117: " he set his mouth, as if her words rained blows on him; he looked as if he had made up his mind to bear anything she might say, in silence. he had deserved it, and there would be relief in having to bear it. but she broke off, and rose as if to fetch something from the next room. before she reached the door she turned back, and stood facing him, self-possessed, and yet defiant and formidable in her composure.  "
Match 2118: " she said. "
Match 2119: "  "
Match 2120: " he exclaimed. but her head was turned away, and he could not say what he wished to say. "
Match 2121: " he concluded. she faced him as he spoke, and gave him her hand. she had suffered and relinquished, she had seen her future turned from one of infinite promise to one of barrenness, and yet, somehow, over what she scarcely knew, and with what results she could hardly foretell, she had conquered. with ralph's eyes upon her, smiling straight back at him serenely and proudly, she knew, for the first time, that she had conquered. she let him kiss her hand.  the streets were empty enough on sunday night, and if the sabbath, and the domestic amusements proper to the sabbath, had not kept people indoors, a high strong wind might very probably have done so. ralph denham was aware of a tumult in the street much in accordance with his own sensations. the gusts, sweeping along the strand, seemed at the same time to blow a clear space across the sky in which stars appeared, and for a short time the quicks-peeding silver moon riding through clouds, as if they were waves of water surging round her and over her. they swamped her, but she emerged; they broke over her and covered her again; she issued forth indomitable. in the country fields all the wreckage of winter was being dispersed; the dead leaves, the withered bracken, the dry and discolored grass, but no bud would be broken, nor would the new stalks that showed above the earth take any harm, and perhaps to-morrow a line of blue or yellow would show through a slit in their green. but the whirl of the atmosphere alone was in denham's mood, and what of star or blossom appeared was only as a light gleaming for a second upon heaped waves fast following each other. he had not been able to speak to mary, though for a moment he had come near enough to be tantalized by a wonderful possibility of understanding. but the desire to communicate something of the very greatest importance possessed him completely; he still wished to bestow this gift upon some other human being; he sought their company. more by instinct than by conscious choice, he took the direction which led to rodney's rooms. he knocked loudly upon his door; but no one answered. he rang the bell. it took him some time to accept the fact that rodney was out. when he could no longer pretend that the sound of the wind in the old building was the sound of some one rising from his chair, he ran downstairs again, as if his goal had been altered and only just revealed to him. he walked in the direction of chelsea.  but physical fatigue, for he had not dined and had tramped both far and fast, made him sit for a moment upon a seat on the embankment. one of the regular occupants of those seats, an elderly man who had drunk himself, probably, out of work and lodging, drifted up, begged a match, and sat down beside him. it was a windy night, he said; times were hard; some long story of bad luck and injustice followed, told so often that the man seemed to be talking to himself, or, perhaps, the neglect of his audience had long made any attempt to catch their attention seem scarcely worth while. when he began to speak ralph had a wild desire to talk to him; to question him; to make him understand. he did, in fact, interrupt him at one point; but it was useless. the ancient story of failure, ill-luck, undeserved disaster, went down the wind, disconnected syllables flying past ralph's ears with a queer alternation of loudness and faintness as if, at certain moments, the man's memory of his wrongs revived and then flagged, dying down at last into a grumble of resignation, which seemed to represent a final lapse into the accustomed despair. the unhappy voice afflicted ralph, but it also angered him. and when the elderly man refused to listen and mumbled on, an odd image came to his mind of a lighthouse besieged by the flying bodies of lost birds, who were dashed senseless, by the gale, against the glass. he had a strange sensation that he was both lighthouse and bird; he was steadfast and brilliant; and at the same time he was whirled, with all other things, senseless against the glass. he got up, left his tribute of silver, and pressed on, with the wind against him. the image of the lighthouse and the storm full of birds persisted, taking the place of more definite thoughts, as he walked past the houses of parliament and down grosvenor road, by the side of the river. in his state of physical fatigue, details merged themselves in the vaster prospect, of which the flying gloom and the intermittent lights of lamp-posts and private houses were the outward token, but he never lost his sense of walking in the direction of katharine's house. he took it for granted that something would then happen, and, as he walked on, his mind became more and more full of pleasure and expectancy. within a certain radius of her house the streets came under the influence of her presence. each house had an individuality known to ralph, because of the tremendous individuality of the house in which she lived. for some yards before reaching the hilberys' door he walked in a trance of pleasure, but when he reached it, and pushed the gate of the little garden open, he hesitated. he did not know what to do next. there was no hurry, however, for the outside of the house held pleasure enough to last him some time longer. he crossed the road, and leant against the balustrade of the embankment, fixing his eyes upon the house.  lights burnt in the three long windows of the drawing-room. the space of the room behind became, in ralph's vision, the center of the dark, flying wilderness of the world; the justification for the welter of confusion surrounding it; the steady light which cast its beams, like those of a lighthouse, with searching composure over the trackless waste. in this little sanctuary were gathered together several different people, but their identity was dissolved in a general glory of something that might, perhaps, be called civilization; at any rate, all dryness, all safety, all that stood up above the surge and preserved a consciousness of its own, was centered in the drawing-room of the hilberys. its purpose was beneficent; and yet so far above his level as to have something austere about it, a light that cast itself out and yet kept itself aloof. then he began, in his mind, to distinguish different individuals within, consciously refusing as yet to attack the figure of katharine. his thoughts lingered over mrs. hilbery and cassandra; and then he turned to rodney and mr. hilbery. physically, he saw them bathed in that steady flow of yellow light which filled the long oblongs of the windows; in their movements they were beautiful; and in their speech he figured a reserve of meaning, unspoken, but understood. at length, after all this half-conscious selection and arrangement, he allowed himself to approach the figure of katharine herself; and instantly the scene was flooded with excitement. he did not see her in the body; he seemed curiously to see her as a shape of light, the light itself; he seemed, simplified and exhausted as he was, to be like one of those lost birds fascinated by the lighthouse and held to the glass by the splendor of the blaze.  these thoughts drove him to tramp a beat up and down the pavement before the hilberys' gate. he did not trouble himself to make any plans for the future. something of an unknown kind would decide both the coming year and the coming hour. now and again, in his vigil, he sought the light in the long windows, or glanced at the ray which gilded a few leaves and a few blades of grass in the little garden. for a long time the light burnt without changing. he had just reached the limit of his beat and was turning, when the front door opened, and the aspect of the house was entirely changed. a black figure came down the little pathway and paused at the gate. denham understood instantly that it was rodney. without hesitation, and conscious only of a great friendliness for any one coming from that lighted room, he walked straight up to him and stopped him. in the flurry of the wind rodney was taken aback, and for the moment tried to press on, muttering something, as if he suspected a demand upon his charity.  "
Match 2122: " he exclaimed, recognizing him.  ralph mumbled something about being on his way home. they walked on together, though rodney walked quick enough to make it plain that he had no wish for company.  he was very unhappy. that afternoon cassandra had repulsed him; he had tried to explain to her the difficulties of the situation, and to suggest the nature of his feelings for her without saying anything definite or anything offensive to her. but he had lost his head; under the goad of katharine's ridicule he had said too much, and cassandra, superb in her dignity and severity, had refused to hear another word, and threatened an immediate return to her home. his agitation, after an evening spent between the two women, was extreme. moreover, he could not help suspecting that ralph was wandering near the hilberys' house, at this hour, for reasons connected with katharine. there was probably some understanding between them--not that anything of the kind mattered to him now. he was convinced that he had never cared for any one save cassandra, and katharine's future was no concern of his. aloud, he said, shortly, that he was very tired and wished to find a cab. but on sunday night, on the embankment, cabs were hard to come by, and rodney found himself constrained to walk some distance, at any rate, in denham's company. denham maintained his silence. rodney's irritation lapsed. he found the silence oddly suggestive of the good masculine qualities which he much respected, and had at this moment great reason to need. after the mystery, difficulty, and uncertainty of dealing with the other sex, intercourse with one's own is apt to have a composing and even ennobling influence, since plain speaking is possible and subterfuges of no avail. rodney, too, was much in need of a confidant; katharine, despite her promises of help, had failed him at the critical moment; she had gone off with denham; she was, perhaps, tormenting denham as she had tormented him. how grave and stable he seemed, speaking little, and walking firmly, compared with what rodney knew of his own torments and indecisions! he began to cast about for some way of telling the story of his relations with katharine and cassandra that would not lower him in denham's eyes. it then occurred to him that, perhaps, katharine herself had confided in denham; they had something in common; it was likely that they had discussed him that very afternoon. the desire to discover what they had said of him now came uppermost in his mind. he recalled katharine's laugh; he remembered that she had gone, laughing, to walk with denham.  "
Match 2123: " he asked abruptly.  "
Match 2124: "  this seemed to confirm rodney's belief that he had been discussed. he turned over the unpalatable idea for a while, in silence.  "
Match 2125: " he then exclaimed.  "
Match 2126: " said denham, who seemed to himself possessed of complete understanding, not merely of women, but of the entire universe. he could read rodney, too, like a book. he knew that he was unhappy, and he pitied him, and wished to help him.  "
Match 2127: " the remainder of the sentence was lost in the high wind, against which they had to struggle; but denham understood that he referred to katharine's laughter, and that the memory of it was still hurting him. in comparison with rodney, denham felt himself very secure; he saw rodney as one of the lost birds dashed senseless against the glass; one of the flying bodies of which the air was full. but he and katharine were alone together, aloft, splendid, and luminous with a twofold radiance. he pitied the unstable creature beside him; he felt a desire to protect him, exposed without the knowledge which made his own way so direct. they were united as the adventurous are united, though one reaches the goal and the other perishes by the way.  "
Match 2128: "  this sentence, apparently addressed to no other human being, reached denham's ears. the wind seemed to muffle it and fly away with it directly. had rodney spoken those words?  "
Match 2129: " was that his own voice, which seemed to sound in the air several yards in front of him?  "
Match 2130: "  "
Match 2131: "  "
Match 2132: "  "
Match 2133: "  the wind blew a space between the words--blew them so far away that they seemed unspoken.  "
Match 2134: "  this was certainly spoken by the man at denham's side. the voice had all the marks of rodney's character, and recalled, with; strange vividness, his personal appearance. denham could see him against the blank buildings and towers of the horizon. he saw him dignified, exalted, and tragic, as he might have appeared thinking of katharine alone in his rooms at night.  "
Match 2135: "  ralph spoke distinctly and deliberately, as if rodney's confession had made this statement necessary.  rodney exclaimed something inarticulate.  "
Match 2136: " he cried, "
Match 2137: "  the cry had a note of despair in it. again the wind intercepted their words. they said no more. at length they drew up beneath a lamp-post, simultaneously.  "
Match 2138: " rodney exclaimed. they looked at each other, queerly, in the light of the lamp. fools! they seemed to confess to each other the extreme depths of their folly. for the moment, under the lamp-post, they seemed to be aware of some common knowledge which did away with the possibility of rivalry, and made them feel more sympathy for each other than for any one else in the world. giving simultaneously a little nod, as if in confirmation of this understanding, they parted without speaking again.    chapter xxix  between twelve and one that sunday night katharine lay in bed, not asleep, but in that twilight region where a detached and humorous view of our own lot is possible; or if we must be serious, our seriousness is tempered by the swift oncome of slumber and oblivion. she saw the forms of ralph, william, cassandra, and herself, as if they were all equally unsubstantial, and, in putting off reality, had gained a kind of dignity which rested upon each impartially. thus rid of any uncomfortable warmth of partisanship or load of obligation, she was dropping off to sleep when a light tap sounded upon her door. a moment later cassandra stood beside her, holding a candle and speaking in the low tones proper to the time of night.  "
Match 2139: "  "
Match 2140: "  she roused herself, sat up, and asked what in heaven's name cassandra was doing?  "
Match 2141: "  "
Match 2142: "  "
Match 2143: "  cassandra spoke formally, almost solemnly; the announcement was clearly prepared and marked a crisis of the utmost gravity. she continued what seemed to be part of a set speech.  "
Match 2144: "  katharine seemed to waken completely, and at once to be in control of herself.  "
Match 2145: " she asked.  "
Match 2146: "  as if foreseeing that the interview might be long, and the night chilly, katharine advised cassandra to wrap herself in a quilt. cassandra did so with unbroken solemnity.  "
Match 2147: " she said. "
Match 2148: "  she was careful to abstain from looking in katharine's direction. there was a slight pause.  "
Match 2149: " said katharine eventually. her voice sounded so astonishingly equable that cassandra glanced at her. it was impossible to suppose that she was either indignant or surprised; she seemed, on the contrary, sitting up in bed, with her arms clasped round her knees and a little frown on her brow, to be thinking closely upon a matter of indifference to her.  "
Match 2150: " cassandra replied, and she added, "
Match 2151: "  "
Match 2152: " katharine inquired.  "
Match 2153: " cassandra exclaimed indignantly. "
Match 2154: "  this was the last of the sentences of her premeditated speech; and having spoken it she was left unprovided with any more to say in that particular style. when katharine remarked:  "
Match 2155: " cassandra's self-possession deserted her.  "
Match 2156: "  "
Match 2157: " katharine asked.  "
Match 2158: " cassandra admitted.  "
Match 2159: "  "
Match 2160: " cassandra allowed once more. she was completely at a loss. in her forecast of the interview she had taken it for granted that katharine, after an outburst of incredulity, would agree that cassandra must return home as soon as possible. but katharine, on the contrary, accepted her statement at once, seemed neither shocked nor surprised, and merely looked rather more thoughtful than usual. from being a mature woman charged with an important mission, cassandra shrunk to the stature of an inexperienced child.  "
Match 2161: " she asked.  katharine made no answer, but still sat deliberating silently, and a certain feeling of alarm took possession of cassandra. perhaps her words had struck far deeper than she had thought, into depths beyond her reach, as so much of katharine was beyond her reach. she thought suddenly that she had been playing with very dangerous tools.  looking at her at length, katharine asked slowly, as if she found the question very difficult to ask.  "
Match 2162: "  she marked the agitation and bewilderment of the girl's expression, and how she looked away from her.  "
Match 2163: " cassandra asked, breathing quickly, and nervously moving her hands.  "
Match 2164: " katharine repeated.  "
Match 2165: " cassandra burst out.  "
Match 2166: "  "
Match 2167: " cassandra exclaimed. "
Match 2168: "  "
Match 2169: " said katharine, after a pause.  "
Match 2170: " cassandra cried.  "
Match 2171: " katharine repeated. "
Match 2172: "  "
Match 2173: " cassandra said again. "
Match 2174: "  "
Match 2175: " said katharine, as if disposing of something for ever and ever.  "
Match 2176: " cassandra said, her whole body and voice seeming to fall and collapse together, and no trace of anger or excitement remaining, but only a dreamy quietude.  "
Match 2177: "  "
Match 2178: " said katharine.  cassandra remained bowed, as if by the weight of the revelation, for some little while longer. nor did katharine speak. her attitude was that of some one who wishes to be concealed as much as possible from observation. she sighed profoundly; she was absolutely silent, and apparently overcome by her thoughts.  "
Match 2179: " she said at length, and shook her pillow, as if making ready for sleep.  cassandra rose obediently, and once more took up her candle. perhaps the white dressing-gown, and the loosened hair, and something unseeing in the expression of the eyes gave her a likeness to a woman walking in her sleep. katharine, at least, thought so.  "
Match 2180: " cassandra said, pausing. "
Match 2181: "  for the first time their eyes met.  "
Match 2182: " cassandra exclaimed, as if she read the certainty there. but as she looked she saw a sight that surprised her. the tears rose slowly in katharine's eyes and stood there, brimming but contained--the tears of some profound emotion, happiness, grief, renunciation; an emotion so complex in its nature that to express it was impossible, and cassandra, bending her head and receiving the tears upon her cheek, accepted them in silence as the consecration of her love.  "
Match 2183: " said the maid, about eleven o'clock on the following morning, "
Match 2184: "  a long wicker basket of flowers and branches had arrived from the country, and katharine, kneeling upon the floor of the drawing-room, was sorting them while cassandra watched her from an arm-chair, and absent-mindedly made spasmodic offers of help which were not accepted. the maid's message had a curious effect upon katharine.  she rose, walked to the window, and, the maid being gone, said emphatically and even tragically:  "
Match 2185: "  cassandra had understood nothing.  "
Match 2186: " katharine repeated.  "
Match 2187: " cassandra asked, not unnaturally.  "
Match 2188: " katharine replied. cassandra's thoughts flew to the subject of her preoccupation.  "
Match 2189: " she inquired.  "
Match 2190: " katharine replied. "
Match 2191: "  the sternness with which this was said suggested that to bring aunt celia upstairs was, for some reason, a disciplinary measure.  "
Match 2192: " cassandra exclaimed, jumping from her chair and showing signs of agitation, "
Match 2193: "  katharine assured her by nodding her head several times, but the manner in which she left the room was not calculated to inspire complete confidence in her diplomacy.  mrs. milvain was sitting, or rather perching, upon the edge of a chair in the servants' room. whether there was any sound reason for her choice of a subterranean chamber, or whether it corresponded with the spirit of her quest, mrs. milvain invariably came in by the back door and sat in the servants' room when she was engaged in confidential family transactions. the ostensible reason she gave was that neither mr. nor mrs. hilbery should be disturbed. but, in truth, mrs. milvain depended even more than most elderly women of her generation upon the delicious emotions of intimacy, agony, and secrecy, and the additional thrill provided by the basement was one not lightly to be forfeited. she protested almost plaintively when katharine proposed to go upstairs.  "
Match 2194: " she said, hesitating reluctantly upon the threshold of her ambush.  "
Match 2195: "  "
Match 2196: " mrs. milvain objected, taking the precaution to speak in a whisper already.  but as katharine's presence was absolutely necessary to the success of the interview, and as katharine obstinately receded up the kitchen stairs, mrs. milvain had no course but to follow her. she glanced furtively about her as she proceeded upstairs, drew her skirts together, and stepped with circumspection past all doors, whether they were open or shut.  "
Match 2197: " she murmured, when the comparative sanctuary of the drawing-room had been reached. "
Match 2198: " she added, glancing at the flowers strewn upon the floor. a moment later she inquired, "
Match 2199: " noticing a handkerchief that cassandra had dropped in her flight.  "
Match 2200: " said katharine, and she spoke so firmly and clearly that mrs. milvain glanced nervously at the main door and then at the curtain which divided the little room with the relics from the drawing-room.  "
Match 2201: " she remarked. "
Match 2202: "  katharine sat down opposite her aunt and said neither yes nor no. she looked past her, and it might have been thought that she was considering very critically the pattern of the curtains. another advantage of the basement, from mrs. milvain's point of view, was that it made it necessary to sit very close together, and the light was dim compared with that which now poured through three windows upon katharine and the basket of flowers, and gave even the slight angular figure of mrs. milvain herself a halo of gold.  "
Match 2203: " said katharine abruptly, with a little jerk of her head.  mrs. milvain felt that it would be easier to tell her niece what she wished to say if they were actually in physical contact, for the spiritual distance between them was formidable. katharine, however, made no overtures, and mrs. milvain, who was possessed of rash but heroic courage, plunged without preface:  "
Match 2204: "  "
Match 2205: " said katharine, with apparent good humor.  "
Match 2206: "  mrs. milvain, whose words had run themselves together, and whose voice had raised its tone almost to one of protest, here ceased, and looked intently at katharine, as if to judge the effect of her communication. a slight rigidity had passed over katharine's face. her lips were pressed together; her eyes were contracted, and they were still fixed upon the curtain. these superficial changes covered an extreme inner loathing such as might follow the display of some hideous or indecent spectacle. the indecent spectacle was her own action beheld for the first time from the outside; her aunt's words made her realize how infinitely repulsive the body of life is without its soul.  "
Match 2207: " she said at length.  mrs. milvain made a gesture as if to bring her closer, but it was not returned.  "
Match 2208: "  "
Match 2209: " said katharine. "
Match 2210: "  "
Match 2211: " said mrs. milvain warmly. "
Match 2212: "  "
Match 2213: " katharine persisted.  mrs. milvain looked at her. was it possible that katharine really doubted? that there was something that mrs. milvain herself did not understand? she braced herself, and pronounced the tremendous words:  "
Match 2214: "  still the words seemed to have curiously little effect.  "
Match 2215: " said katharine, "
Match 2216: "  "
Match 2217: "  katharine remained silent. the silence alarmed mrs. milvain, and she began hurriedly:  "
Match 2218: "  again she stretched forth her arms, but they remained empty.  "
Match 2219: " said katharine suddenly. "
Match 2220: "  katharine spoke so low and with such restraint that mrs. milvain had to strain to catch her words, and when she heard them she was dazed by them.  "
Match 2221: " she exclaimed. she quivered, and a kind of sob shook her; but even to have made katharine angry was some relief, and allowed her to feel some of the agreeable sensations of martyrdom.  "
Match 2222: " said katharine, standing up, "
Match 2223: "  at these words mrs. milvain looked for a moment terribly apprehensive; she glanced at her niece's face, but read no pity there, whereupon she folded her hands upon a black velvet bag which she carried in an attitude that was almost one of prayer. whatever divinity she prayed to, if pray she did, at any rate she recovered her dignity in a singular way and faced her niece.  "
Match 2224: " she said slowly and with emphasis upon every word, "
Match 2225: "  katharine seemed to judge this defence upon its merits, and then to convict it of falsity.  "
Match 2226: " she said.  at these words mrs. milvain rose and stood for a moment beside her niece. she had never met with such treatment before, and she did not know with what weapons to break down the terrible wall of resistance offered her by one who, by virtue of youth and beauty and sex, should have been all tears and supplications. but mrs. milvain herself was obstinate; upon a matter of this kind she could not admit that she was either beaten or mistaken. she beheld herself the champion of married love in its purity and supremacy; what her niece stood for she was quite unable to say, but she was filled with the gravest suspicions. the old woman and the young woman stood side by side in unbroken silence. mrs. milvain could not make up her mind to withdraw while her principles trembled in the balance and her curiosity remained unappeased. she ransacked her mind for some question that should force katharine to enlighten her, but the supply was limited, the choice difficult, and while she hesitated the door opened and william rodney came in. he carried in his hand an enormous and splendid bunch of white and purple flowers, and, either not seeing mrs. milvain, or disregarding her, he advanced straight to katharine, and presented the flowers with the words:  "
Match 2227: "  katharine took them with a glance that mrs. milvain did not fail to intercept. but with all her experience, she did not know what to make of it. she watched anxiously for further illumination. william greeted her without obvious sign of guilt, and, explaining that he had a holiday, both he and katharine seemed to take it for granted that his holiday should be celebrated with flowers and spent in cheyne walk. a pause followed; that, too, was natural; and mrs. milvain began to feel that she laid herself open to a charge of selfishness if she stayed. the mere presence of a young man had altered her disposition curiously, and filled her with a desire for a scene which should end in an emotional forgiveness. she would have given much to clasp both nephew and niece in her arms. but she could not flatter herself that any hope of the customary exaltation remained.  "
Match 2228: " she said, and she was conscious of an extreme flatness of spirit.  neither of them said anything to stop her. william politely escorted her downstairs, and somehow, amongst her protests and embarrassments, mrs. milvain forgot to say good-bye to katharine. she departed, murmuring words about masses of flowers and a drawing-room always beautiful even in the depths of winter.  william came back to katharine; he found her standing where he had left her.  "
Match 2229: " he said. "
Match 2230: "  she could not bring herself to answer him until she had rid her mind of the impression that her aunt had made on her. it seemed to her that the very flowers were contaminated, and cassandra's pocket-handkerchief, for mrs. milvain had used them for evidence in her investigations.  "
Match 2231: " she said, "
Match 2232: "  "
Match 2233: " rodney exclaimed. "
Match 2234: "  his air of open confidence entirely vanished.  "
Match 2235: "  "
Match 2236: " he asked.  "
Match 2237: "  "
Match 2238: " he exclaimed.  he walked to the window in evident perturbation. katharine was too indignant to attend to him. she was swept away by the force of her own anger. clasping rodney's flowers, she stood upright and motionless.  rodney turned away from the window.  "
Match 2239: " he said. "
Match 2240: "  "
Match 2241: " katharine burst out, not listening to him. "
Match 2242: "  "
Match 2243: "  at length katharine realized some part of what he meant.  "
Match 2244: " she asked in amazement.  "
Match 2245: " he said, flushing. "
Match 2246: " he paused in embarrassment.  "
Match 2247: " he resumed, with a change of voice, "
Match 2248: "  no doubt her beauty, intensified by emotion and enhanced by the flowers of bright color and strange shape which she carried wrought upon rodney, and had its share in bestowing upon her the old romance. but a less noble passion worked in him, too; he was inflamed by jealousy. his tentative offer of affection had been rudely and, as he thought, completely repulsed by cassandra on the preceding day. denham's confession was in his mind. and ultimately, katharine's dominion over him was of the sort that the fevers of the night cannot exorcise.  "
Match 2249: " she said gently, disregarding his question. "
Match 2250: "  "
Match 2251: " william exclaimed. "
Match 2252: "  katharine hesitated. she was confused, agitated, physically tired, and had already to reckon with the violent feeling of dislike aroused by her aunt which still vibrated through all the rest of her feelings. she sank into a chair and dropped her flowers upon her lap.  "
Match 2253: " rodney continued. "
Match 2254: "  he stood over her, as if in readiness to seize the first sign of her assent. precisely at that moment, owing, perhaps, to her vicissitudes of feeling, all sense of love left her, as in a moment a mist lifts from the earth. and when the mist departed a skeleton world and blankness alone remained--a terrible prospect for the eyes of the living to behold. he saw the look of terror in her face, and without understanding its origin, took her hand in his. with the sense of companionship returned a desire, like that of a child for shelter, to accept what he had to offer her--and at that moment it seemed that he offered her the only thing that could make it tolerable to live. she let him press his lips to her cheek, and leant her head upon his arm. it was the moment of his triumph. it was the only moment in which she belonged to him and was dependent upon his protection.  "
Match 2255: " he murmured, "
Match 2256: "  for a moment she remained silent. he then heard her murmur:  "
Match 2257: "  "
Match 2258: " he whispered.  "
Match 2259: " katharine repeated. she raised herself and repeated the sentence yet a third time. "
Match 2260: "  william slowly raised himself. he believed instinctively what katharine said, but what it meant to him he was unable to understand. could cassandra love him? could she have told katharine that she loved him? the desire to know the truth of this was urgent, unknown though the consequences might be. the thrill of excitement associated with the thought of cassandra once more took possession of him. no longer was it the excitement of anticipation and ignorance; it was the excitement of something greater than a possibility, for now he knew her and had measure of the sympathy between them. but who could give him certainty? could katharine, katharine who had lately lain in his arms, katharine herself the most admired of women? he looked at her, with doubt, and with anxiety, but said nothing.  "
Match 2261: " she said, interpreting his wish for assurance, "
Match 2262: "  "
Match 2263: "  katharine nodded.  "
Match 2264: "  he clenched his hands and turned away. he suddenly faced her and demanded: "
Match 2265: "  "
Match 2266: " she asked. "
Match 2267: " she exclaimed, as if she had found the answer to some momentarily perplexing question. "
Match 2268: "  he tried to compose himself. he walked up and down the room; he paused at the window and surveyed the flowers strewn upon the floor. meanwhile his desire to have katharine's assurance confirmed became so insistent that he could no longer deny the overmastering strength of his feeling for cassandra.  "
Match 2269: " he exclaimed, coming to a standstill and rapping his knuckles sharply upon a small table carrying one slender vase. "
Match 2270: "  as he said this, the curtains hanging at the door of the little room parted, and cassandra herself stepped forth.  "
Match 2271: " she exclaimed.  a pause succeeded this announcement. rodney made a step forward and said:  "
Match 2272: "  she put her hands before her face; she turned away and seemed to shrink from both of them.  "
Match 2273: " she murmured. "
Match 2274: " she added, raising her head with a look of fear from the kiss with which he greeted her admission, "
Match 2275: "  "
Match 2276: " william answered her, "
Match 2277: "  "
Match 2278: " katharine interposed; "
Match 2279: "  but, still holding william's hand, questions and desires welled up in cassandra's heart. had she done wrong in listening? why did aunt celia blame her? did katharine think her right? above all, did william really love her, for ever and ever, better than any one?  "
Match 2280: " she exclaimed. "
Match 2281: "  "
Match 2282: " said katharine. she moved a little away from where they sat and began half-consciously sorting her flowers.  "
Match 2283: " cassandra said. "
Match 2284: " she added. "
Match 2285: "  "
Match 2286: " william interposed.  "
Match 2287: "--cassandra tried to enlighten him--"
Match 2288: "  "
Match 2289: "  "
Match 2290: " cassandra interposed. "
Match 2291: "  katharine had listened to this attempt at analysis with keen attention. cassandra's words seemed to rub the old blurred image of life and freshen it so marvelously that it looked new again. she turned to william.  "
Match 2292: " she said. "
Match 2293: "  "
Match 2294: " cassandra continued, still reading from her invisible book. "
Match 2295: "  they were silent. at length william broke the silence.  "
Match 2296: " he said, and the old nervousness of manner returned as he glanced at katharine. "
Match 2297: "  cassandra ratified this conclusion so far as she was concerned, and william, after receiving the exquisite pleasure of her glance, with its absolute affection and trust, looked anxiously at katharine.  "
Match 2298: " she assured him. "
Match 2299: "  "
Match 2300: " cassandra cried, holding out her arms while the tears ran down her cheeks.    chapter xxx  the day was so different from other days to three people in the house that the common routine of household life--the maid waiting at table, mrs. hilbery writing a letter, the clock striking, and the door opening, and all the other signs of long-established civilization appeared suddenly to have no meaning save as they lulled mr. and mrs. hilbery into the belief that nothing unusual had taken place. it chanced that mrs. hilbery was depressed without visible cause, unless a certain crudeness verging upon coarseness in the temper of her favorite elizabethans could be held responsible for the mood. at any rate, she had shut up "
Match 2301: " with a sigh, and wished to know, so she told rodney at dinner, whether there wasn't some young writer with a touch of the great spirit--somebody who made you believe that life was beautiful? she got little help from rodney, and after singing her plaintive requiem for the death of poetry by herself, she charmed herself into good spirits again by remembering the existence of mozart. she begged cassandra to play to her, and when they went upstairs cassandra opened the piano directly, and did her best to create an atmosphere of unmixed beauty. at the sound of the first notes katharine and rodney both felt an enormous sense of relief at the license which the music gave them to loosen their hold upon the mechanism of behavior. they lapsed into the depths of thought. mrs. hilbery was soon spirited away into a perfectly congenial mood, that was half reverie and half slumber, half delicious melancholy and half pure bliss. mr. hilbery alone attended. he was extremely musical, and made cassandra aware that he listened to every note. she played her best, and won his approval. leaning slightly forward in his chair, and turning his little green stone, he weighed the intention of her phrases approvingly, but stopped her suddenly to complain of a noise behind him. the window was unhasped. he signed to rodney, who crossed the room immediately to put the matter right. he stayed a moment longer by the window than was, perhaps, necessary, and having done what was needed, drew his chair a little closer than before to katharine's side. the music went on. under cover of some exquisite run of melody, he leant towards her and whispered something. she glanced at her father and mother, and a moment later left the room, almost unobserved, with rodney.  "
Match 2302: " she asked, as soon as the door was shut.  rodney made no answer, but led her downstairs into the dining-room on the ground floor. even when he had shut the door he said nothing, but went straight to the window and parted the curtains. he beckoned to katharine.  "
Match 2303: " he said. "
Match 2304: "  katharine looked. she had no idea what rodney was talking about. a vague feeling of alarm and mystery possessed her. she saw a man standing on the opposite side of the road facing the house beneath a lamp-post. as they looked the figure turned, walked a few steps, and came back again to his old position. it seemed to her that he was looking fixedly at her, and was conscious of her gaze on him. she knew, in a flash, who the man was who was watching them. she drew the curtain abruptly.  "
Match 2305: " said rodney. "
Match 2306: " he spoke sternly. his whole manner had become full of authority. katharine felt almost as if he accused her of some crime. she was pale and uncomfortably agitated, as much by the strangeness of rodney's behavior as by the sight of ralph denham.  "
Match 2307: " she said defiantly.  "
Match 2308: " rodney spoke with such decision that when he raised his arm katharine expected him to draw the curtain instantly. she caught his hand with a little exclamation.  "
Match 2309: " she cried. "
Match 2310: "  "
Match 2311: " he replied. "
Match 2312: " his hand remained upon the curtain. "
Match 2313: " he broke out, looking at her with an expression of contempt as well as of anger, "
Match 2314: "  she looked at him, wondering, in spite of all her perplexity, at the spirit that possessed him.  "
Match 2315: " she said.  he reflected, and then took his hand away.  "
Match 2316: " he concluded. "
Match 2317: "  "
Match 2318: " she said, shaking her head. she bent her head in thought.  "
Match 2319: " rodney said suddenly. his tone had lost something of its sternness, and might have been used to urge a child to confess its fault. she raised her eyes and fixed them upon him.  "
Match 2320: " she repeated. he nodded. she searched his face, as if for further confirmation of his words, and, as he remained silent and expectant, turned away once more and continued her thoughts. he observed her closely, but without stirring, as if he gave her time to make up her mind to fulfil her obvious duty. the strains of mozart reached them from the room above.  "
Match 2321: " she said suddenly, with a sort of desperation, rising from her chair and seeming to command rodney to fulfil his part. he drew the curtain instantly, and she made no attempt to stop him. their eyes at once sought the same spot beneath the lamp-post.  "
Match 2322: " she exclaimed.  no one was there. william threw the window up and looked out. the wind rushed into the room, together with the sound of distant wheels, footsteps hurrying along the pavement, and the cries of sirens hooting down the river.  "
Match 2323: " william cried.  "
Match 2324: " said katharine, but she spoke scarcely louder than she might have spoken to some one in the same room. with their eyes fixed upon the opposite side of the road, they did not notice a figure close to the railing which divided the garden from the street. but denham had crossed the road and was standing there. they were startled by his voice close at hand.  "
Match 2325: "  "
Match 2326: " rodney went to the front door and opened it. "
Match 2327: " he said, bringing ralph with him into the dining-room where katharine stood, with her back to the open window. their eyes met for a second. denham looked half dazed by the strong light, and, buttoned in his overcoat, with his hair ruffled across his forehead by the wind, he seemed like somebody rescued from an open boat out at sea. william promptly shut the window and drew the curtains. he acted with a cheerful decision as if he were master of the situation, and knew exactly what he meant to do.  "
Match 2328: " he said. "
Match 2329: "  "
Match 2330: " ralph began vaguely, holding out his hat and glancing about him; he balanced it carefully against a silver bowl that stood upon the sideboard. he then sat himself down rather heavily at the head of the oval dinner-table. rodney stood on one side of him and katharine on the other. he appeared to be presiding over some meeting from which most of the members were absent. meanwhile, he waited, and his eyes rested upon the glow of the beautifully polished mahogany table.  "
Match 2331: " said katharine briefly.  at that denham looked up quickly at rodney. rodney's expression changed. he lost his self-possession. he smiled a little nervously, and then his attention seemed to be caught by a fragment of melody from the floor above. he seemed for a moment to forget the presence of the others. he glanced towards the door.  "
Match 2332: " said denham.  "
Match 2333: " he said. "
Match 2334: " he looked oddly round the room as if he wished to make sure that the scene in which he played a part had some real existence. "
Match 2335: " he repeated. "
Match 2336: " his gaze rested upon her finally, as if she, too, had changed from his old view of her. he smiled at her as if to encourage her. "
Match 2337: " he said, and giving a little nod to denham, he left the room.  katharine sat down at once, and leant her chin upon her hands. so long as rodney was in the room the proceedings of the evening had seemed to be in his charge, and had been marked by a certain unreality. now that she was alone with ralph she felt at once that a constraint had been taken from them both. she felt that they were alone at the bottom of the house, which rose, story upon story, upon the top of them.  "
Match 2338: " she asked.  "
Match 2339: " he replied.  "
Match 2340: "  "
Match 2341: "  "
Match 2342: " she had called unconsciously.  "
Match 2343: " she told him, after a pause.  "
Match 2344: " he asked.  she bent her head. "
Match 2345: " she sighed. "
Match 2346: " ralph made a sound of understanding. "
Match 2347: " she asked.  "
Match 2348: " denham replied.  the words seemed to fill the room with an emotion which katharine connected with the sound of distant wheels, the footsteps hurrying along the pavement, the cries of sirens hooting down the river, the darkness and the wind. she saw the upright figure standing beneath the lamp-post.  "
Match 2349: " she said, glancing at the window, as if he saw what she was seeing. "
Match 2350: " she broke off. "
Match 2351: "  placing her elbows on the table, she slid her ruby ring up and down her finger abstractedly. she frowned at the rows of leather-bound books opposite her. ralph looked keenly at her. very pale, but sternly concentrated upon her meaning, beautiful but so little aware of herself as to seem remote from him also, there was something distant and abstract about her which exalted him and chilled him at the same time.  "
Match 2352: " he said. "
Match 2353: "  "
Match 2354: " she mused.  some detached instinct made her aware that she was gazing at a book which belonged by rights to some other part of the house. she walked over to the shelf, took it down, and returned to her seat, placing the book on the table between them. ralph opened it and looked at the portrait of a man with a voluminous white shirt-collar, which formed the frontispiece.  "
Match 2355: " he affirmed, shutting the book. "
Match 2356: "  "
Match 2357: "  "
Match 2358: "  "
Match 2359: " she replied, "
Match 2360: " she went on quickly, changing her position and frowning again, "
Match 2361: "  "
Match 2362: " he urged.  but she could not reduce her vision to words, since it was no single shape colored upon the dark, but rather a general excitement, an atmosphere, which, when she tried to visualize it, took form as a wind scouring the flanks of northern hills and flashing light upon cornfields and pools.  "
Match 2363: " she sighed, laughing at the ridiculous notion of putting any part of this into words.  "
Match 2364: " ralph urged her.  "
Match 2365: " she was dismayed by the expression of longing and despair upon his face. "
Match 2366: " she attempted. "
Match 2367: "  "
Match 2368: " he pressed her.  "
Match 2369: " she seemed to be disappointing the desire of a child. his face fell.  "
Match 2370: "  "
Match 2371: " she could not explain that she was essentially alone there. "
Match 2372: "  "
Match 2373: "  "
Match 2374: " she sighed. "
Match 2375: " she turned upon him almost fiercely. "
Match 2376: " she said.  "
Match 2377: " he replied roughly, "
Match 2378: " he stopped. he realized that the moment had come to impart that news of the utmost importance which he had tried to impart to mary datchet, to rodney upon the embankment, to the drunken tramp upon the seat. how should he offer it to katharine? he looked quickly at her. he saw that she was only half attentive to him; only a section of her was exposed to him. the sight roused in him such desperation that he had much ado to control his impulse to rise and leave the house. her hand lay loosely curled upon the table. he seized it and grasped it firmly as if to make sure of her existence and of his own. "
Match 2379: " he said.  some roundness or warmth essential to that statement was absent from his voice, and she had merely to shake her head very slightly for him to drop her hand and turn away in shame at his own impotence. he thought that she had detected his wish to leave her. she had discerned the break in his resolution, the blankness in the heart of his vision. it was true that he had been happier out in the street, thinking of her, than now that he was in the same room with her. he looked at her with a guilty expression on his face. but her look expressed neither disappointment nor reproach. her pose was easy, and she seemed to give effect to a mood of quiet speculation by the spinning of her ruby ring upon the polished table. denham forgot his despair in wondering what thoughts now occupied her.  "
Match 2380: " he said. his tone was humble, and made her smile at him.  "
Match 2381: " she asked, holding it out.  "
Match 2382: " he replied, in the same tone of half-humorous gravity.  "
Match 2383: "  "
Match 2384: "  "
Match 2385: " she added casually enough. "
Match 2386: " she said slipping her ring back to its old position, "
Match 2387: "  she looked at him gravely and inquiringly, as if in search of help.  "
Match 2388: " he stated.  "
Match 2389: " she replied.  in order to explain to her his state of mind, ralph recounted his experience with the photograph, the letter, and the flower picked at kew. she listened very seriously.  "
Match 2390: " she mused. "
Match 2391: " she hazarded. "
Match 2392: "  this conclusion seemed fantastic and profoundly unsatisfactory to ralph, but after the astonishing variations of his own sentiments during the past half-hour he could not accuse her of fanciful exaggeration.  "
Match 2393: " he said almost bitterly. the music, which had ceased, had now begun again, and the melody of mozart seemed to express the easy and exquisite love of the two upstairs.  "
Match 2394: " she glanced at him as if to ascertain his position, "
Match 2395: "  "
Match 2396: "  "
Match 2397: " she concluded, as the window shook beneath the pressure of the wind. they listened to the sound in silence.  here the door opened with considerable hesitation, and mrs. hilbery's head appeared, at first with an air of caution, but having made sure that she had admitted herself to the dining-room and not to some more unusual region, she came completely inside and seemed in no way taken aback by the sight she saw. she seemed, as usual, bound on some quest of her own which was interrupted pleasantly but strangely by running into one of those queer, unnecessary ceremonies that other people thought fit to indulge in.  "
Match 2398: " she was at a loss, as usual, for the name, and katharine thought that she did not recognize him. "
Match 2399: " she added, pointing to the book upon the table. "
Match 2400: " she said.  katharine, who had risen in some confusion, could not help smiling at the thought that her mother found it perfectly natural and desirable that her daughter should be reading byron in the dining-room late at night alone with a strange young man. she blessed a disposition that was so convenient, and felt tenderly towards her mother and her mother's eccentricities. but ralph observed that although mrs. hilbery held the book so close to her eyes she was not reading a word.  "
Match 2401: " katharine exclaimed, changing astonishingly in the space of a minute to her usual condition of authoritative good sense. "
Match 2402: "  "
Match 2403: " said mrs. hilbery, addressing ralph denham.  "
Match 2404: " katharine said, as if prompting her memory.  "
Match 2405: " mrs. hilbery exclaimed, with a sudden laugh that rather puzzled her daughter.  ralph found that she had turned upon him a gaze that was at once very vague and very penetrating.  "
Match 2406: " mrs. hilbery continued. ("
Match 2407: " she added parenthetically.) "
Match 2408: " she went on, "
Match 2409: " she added. "
Match 2410: " she waved her hand, as if to indicate the wealth of unwritten poetry all about them. "
Match 2411: " she sighed, "
Match 2412: "  during this speech of her mother's katharine had turned away, and ralph felt that mrs. hilbery was talking to him apart, with a desire to ascertain something about him which she veiled purposely by the vagueness of her words. he felt curiously encouraged and heartened by the beam in her eye rather than by her actual words. from the distance of her age and sex she seemed to be waving to him, hailing him as a ship sinking beneath the horizon might wave its flag of greeting to another setting out upon the same voyage. he bent his head, saying nothing, but with a curious certainty that she had read an answer to her inquiry that satisfied her. at any rate, she rambled off into a description of the law courts which turned to a denunciation of english justice, which, according to her, imprisoned poor men who couldn't pay their debts. "
Match 2413: " she asked, but at this point katharine gently insisted that her mother should go to bed. looking back from half-way up the staircase, katharine seemed to see denham's eyes watching her steadily and intently with an expression that she had guessed in them when he stood looking at the windows across the road.    chapter xxxi  the tray which brought katharine's cup of tea the next morning brought, also, a note from her mother, announcing that it was her intention to catch an early train to stratford-on-avon that very day.  "
Match 2414: " the note ran, "
Match 2415: "  this was no momentary impulse. mrs. hilbery had been dreaming of shakespeare any time these six months, toying with the idea of an excursion to what she considered the heart of the civilized world. to stand six feet above shakespeare's bones, to see the very stones worn by his feet, to reflect that the oldest man's oldest mother had very likely seen shakespeare's daughter--such thoughts roused an emotion in her, which she expressed at unsuitable moments, and with a passion that would not have been unseemly in a pilgrim to a sacred shrine. the only strange thing was that she wished to go by herself. but, naturally enough, she was well provided with friends who lived in the neighborhood of shakespeare's tomb, and were delighted to welcome her; and she left later to catch her train in the best of spirits. there was a man selling violets in the street. it was a fine day. she would remember to send mr. hilbery the first daffodil she saw. and, as she ran back into the hall to tell katharine, she felt, she had always felt, that shakespeare's command to leave his bones undisturbed applied only to odious curiosity-mongers--not to dear sir john and herself. leaving her daughter to cogitate the theory of anne hathaway's sonnets, and the buried manuscripts here referred to, with the implied menace to the safety of the heart of civilization itself, she briskly shut the door of her taxi-cab, and was whirled off upon the first stage of her pilgrimage.  the house was oddly different without her. katharine found the maids already in possession of her room, which they meant to clean thoroughly during her absence. to katharine it seemed as if they had brushed away sixty years or so with the first flick of their damp dusters. it seemed to her that the work she had tried to do in that room was being swept into a very insignificant heap of dust. the china shepherdesses were already shining from a bath of hot water. the writing-table might have belonged to a professional man of methodical habits.  gathering together a few papers upon which she was at work, katharine proceeded to her own room with the intention of looking through them, perhaps, in the course of the morning. but she was met on the stairs by cassandra, who followed her up, but with such intervals between each step that katharine began to feel her purpose dwindling before they had reached the door. cassandra leant over the banisters, and looked down upon the persian rug that lay on the floor of the hall.  "
Match 2416: " she inquired. "
Match 2417: "  the dull old letters, which would have turned the heads of the most sober of collectors, were laid upon a table, and, after a moment's pause, cassandra, looking grave all of a sudden, asked katharine where she should find the "
Match 2418: " by lord macaulay. it was downstairs in mr. hilbery's study. the cousins descended together in search of it. they diverged into the drawing-room for the good reason that the door was open. the portrait of richard alardyce attracted their attention.  "
Match 2419: " it was a question that katharine had often asked herself lately.  "
Match 2420: " cassandra replied. "
Match 2421: " she added a little defensively.  down they went into mr. hilbery's study, where they began to look among his books. so desultory was this examination that some fifteen minutes failed to discover the work they were in search of.  "
Match 2422: " katharine asked, with a stretch of her arms.  "
Match 2423: " cassandra replied briefly.  "
Match 2424: "  "
Match 2425: "  "
Match 2426: " katharine asked, turning to the shelves again.  "
Match 2427: "  "
Match 2428: "  "
Match 2429: "  "
Match 2430: "  "
Match 2431: "  "
Match 2432: " katharine replied.  "
Match 2433: " she said impulsively, "
Match 2434: "  "
Match 2435: "  "
Match 2436: "  "
Match 2437: " said katharine, turning round with the book in her hand. "
Match 2438: "  "
Match 2439: " cried cassandra, slapping the book upon the table. "
Match 2440: "  "
Match 2441: " katharine replied evasively.  "
Match 2442: " said cassandra, looking ruefully at the dull red cover of the prescribed volume, which, however, possessed a talismanic property, since william admired it. he had advised a little serious reading for the morning hours.  "
Match 2443: " she asked.  "
Match 2444: " as she spoke she saw the light fade from cassandra's face, as if she had implied some other, more mysterious, relationship. she was stung with compunction. she marveled at her own rashness in having influenced the life of another, as she had influenced cassandra's life.  "
Match 2445: " she said quickly.  "
Match 2446: " said cassandra, with a little shudder, and her look showed that she spoke the truth. she turned and glanced at katharine as she had never glanced at her before. there was fear in her glance, which darted on her and then dropped guiltily. oh, katharine had everything--beauty, mind, character. she could never compete with katharine; she could never be safe so long as katharine brooded over her, dominating her, disposing of her. she called her cold, unseeing, unscrupulous, but the only sign she gave outwardly was a curious one--she reached out her hand and grasped the volume of history. at that moment the bell of the telephone rang and katharine went to answer it. cassandra, released from observation, dropped her book and clenched her hands. she suffered more fiery torture in those few minutes than she had suffered in the whole of her life; she learnt more of her capacities for feeling. but when katharine reappeared she was calm, and had gained a look of dignity that was new to her.  "
Match 2447: " she asked.  "
Match 2448: " katharine replied.  "
Match 2449: "  "
Match 2450: " the accusation that katharine was calm, callous, and indifferent was not possible in face of her present air of animation. she gave cassandra no time to frame an answer. "
Match 2451: " she asked.  cassandra made no reply for some moments. it was, indeed, a very difficult question to answer. in conversation the night before, william had indicated to cassandra that, in his belief, katharine was becoming engaged to ralph denham in the dining-room. cassandra, in the rosy light of her own circumstances, had been disposed to think that the matter must be settled already. but a letter which she had received that morning from william, while ardent in its expression of affection, had conveyed to her obliquely that he would prefer the announcement of their engagement to coincide with that of katharine's. this document cassandra now produced, and read aloud, with considerable excisions and much hesitation.  "
Match 2452: "  "
Match 2453: " katharine exclaimed, having gathered the drift of these remarks with a speed that, by itself, disconcerted cassandra.  "
Match 2454: " cassandra replied. "
Match 2455: "  "
Match 2456: "  cassandra was silent. the prospect appalled her. katharine had been telephoning to ralph denham; she looked queer, too; she must be, or about to become, engaged to him. but if cassandra could have overheard the conversation upon the telephone, she would not have felt so certain that it tended in that direction. it was to this effect:  "
Match 2457: "  "
Match 2458: "  "
Match 2459: "  "
Match 2460: "  "
Match 2461: "  "
Match 2462: "  "
Match 2463: "  "
Match 2464: "  a long pause followed. ralph began a sentence, which he canceled with the word, "
Match 2465: " suddenly, together, at the same moment, they said good-bye. and yet, if the telephone had been miraculously connected with some higher atmosphere pungent with the scent of thyme and the savor of salt, katharine could hardly have breathed in a keener sense of exhilaration. she ran downstairs on the crest of it. she was amazed to find herself already committed by william and cassandra to marry the owner of the halting voice she had just heard on the telephone. the tendency of her spirit seemed to be in an altogether different direction; and of a different nature. she had only to look at cassandra to see what the love that results in an engagement and marriage means. she considered for a moment, and then said: "
Match 2466: "  "
Match 2467: " said cassandra. "
Match 2468: "  this interpretation of what she was used to call william's conventionality was new to katharine. and yet she felt it now to be the true one.  "
Match 2469: " she said.  "
Match 2470: "  whether this applied also to the sentiments expressed in the letter, katharine was not so sure; but when william's solicitude was spent upon cassandra it not only failed to irritate her, as it had done when she was the object of it, but appeared, as cassandra said, the fruit of his love of beauty.  "
Match 2471: " she said, "
Match 2472: "  "
Match 2473: " said cassandra. "
Match 2474: "  this remark made katharine realize the depths of their intimacy better than any other words could have done; she was jealous for one moment; but the next she was humiliated. she had known william for years, and she had never once guessed that he loved children. she looked at the queer glow of exaltation in cassandra's eyes, through which she was beholding the true spirit of a human being, and wished that she would go on talking about william for ever. cassandra was not unwilling to gratify her. she talked on. the morning slipped away. katharine scarcely changed her position on the edge of her father's writing-table, and cassandra never opened the "
Match 2475: "  and yet it must be confessed that there were vast lapses in the attention which katharine bestowed upon her cousin. the atmosphere was wonderfully congenial for thoughts of her own. she lost herself sometimes in such deep reverie that cassandra, pausing, could look at her for moments unperceived. what could katharine be thinking about, unless it were ralph denham? she was satisfied, by certain random replies, that katharine had wandered a little from the subject of william's perfections. but katharine made no sign. she always ended these pauses by saying something so natural that cassandra was deluded into giving fresh examples of her absorbing theme. then they lunched, and the only sign that katharine gave of abstraction was to forget to help the pudding. she looked so like her mother, as she sat there oblivious of the tapioca, that cassandra was startled into exclaiming:  "
Match 2476: "  "
Match 2477: " said katharine, with more irritation than the remark seemed to call for.  in truth, now that her mother was away, katharine did feel less sensible than usual, but as she argued it to herself, there was much less need for sense. secretly, she was a little shaken by the evidence which the morning had supplied of her immense capacity for--what could one call it?--rambling over an infinite variety of thoughts that were too foolish to be named. she was, for example, walking down a road in northumberland in the august sunset; at the inn she left her companion, who was ralph denham, and was transported, not so much by her own feet as by some invisible means, to the top of a high hill. here the scents, the sounds among the dry heather-roots, the grass-blades pressed upon the palm of her hand, were all so perceptible that she could experience each one separately. after this her mind made excursions into the dark of the air, or settled upon the surface of the sea, which could be discovered over there, or with equal unreason it returned to its couch of bracken beneath the stars of midnight, and visited the snow valleys of the moon. these fancies would have been in no way strange, since the walls of every mind are decorated with some such tracery, but she found herself suddenly pursuing such thoughts with an extreme ardor, which became a desire to change her actual condition for something matching the conditions of her dream. then she started; then she awoke to the fact that cassandra was looking at her in amazement.  cassandra would have liked to feel certain that, when katharine made no reply at all or one wide of the mark, she was making up her mind to get married at once, but it was difficult, if this were so, to account for some remarks that katharine let fall about the future. she recurred several times to the summer, as if she meant to spend that season in solitary wandering. she seemed to have a plan in her mind which required bradshaws and the names of inns.  cassandra was driven finally, by her own unrest, to put on her clothes and wander out along the streets of chelsea, on the pretence that she must buy something. but, in her ignorance of the way, she became panic-stricken at the thought of being late, and no sooner had she found the shop she wanted, than she fled back again in order to be at home when william came. he came, indeed, five minutes after she had sat down by the tea-table, and she had the happiness of receiving him alone. his greeting put her doubts of his affection at rest, but the first question he asked was:  "
Match 2478: "  "
Match 2479: "  william frowned, and looked annoyed.  "
Match 2480: " cassandra added by way of cheering him.  "
Match 2481: "  he left his sentence unfinished, for at this point katharine herself appeared. with his recollections of the scene the night before, he was too self-conscious even to look at her, and it was not until she told him of her mother's visit to stratford-on-avon that he raised his eyes. it was clear that he was greatly relieved. he looked round him now, as if he felt at his ease, and cassandra exclaimed:  "
Match 2482: "  "
Match 2483: " he asked.  "
Match 2484: " said katharine. "
Match 2485: " but as she said this, with a decision which seemed to make it imply that more than the sofa was unchanged, she held out a cup into which she had forgotten to pour any tea. being told of her forgetfulness, she frowned with annoyance, and said that cassandra was demoralizing her. the glance she cast upon them, and the resolute way in which she plunged them into speech, made william and cassandra feel like children who had been caught prying. they followed her obediently, making conversation. any one coming in might have judged them acquaintances met, perhaps, for the third time. if that were so, one must have concluded that the hostess suddenly bethought her of an engagement pressing for fulfilment. first katharine looked at her watch, and then she asked william to tell her the right time. when told that it was ten minutes to five she rose at once, and said:  "
Match 2486: "  she left the room, holding her unfinished bread and butter in her hand. william glanced at cassandra.  "
Match 2487: " cassandra exclaimed.  william looked perturbed. he knew more of katharine than cassandra did, but even he could not tell--. in a second katharine was back again dressed in outdoor things, still holding her bread and butter in her bare hand.  "
Match 2488: " she said. "
Match 2489: " and so saying, she left them.  "
Match 2490: " william exclaimed, as the door shut, "
Match 2491: " they ran to the window, and saw her walking rapidly along the street towards the city. then she vanished.  "
Match 2492: " cassandra exclaimed.  "
Match 2493: " william interjected.  the incident impressed them both as having something queer and ominous about it out of all proportion to its surface strangeness.  "
Match 2494: " said cassandra, as if in explanation.  william shook his head, and paced up and down the room looking extremely perturbed.  "
Match 2495: " he burst out. "
Match 2496: "  "
Match 2497: " cassandra implored.  "
Match 2498: "  cassandra was equally stricken by the sight of william's agitation, and appalled by the prospect of his desertion.  "
Match 2499: " she exclaimed wildly, glancing at the curtain which separated the room with the relics.  "
Match 2500: " said william sarcastically.  she saw that he was losing his temper with the difficulties of the situation. her instinct told her that an appeal to his affection, at this moment, would be extremely ill-judged. she controlled herself, sat down, poured out a fresh cup of tea, and sipped it quietly. this natural action, arguing complete self-mastery, and showing her in one of those feminine attitudes which william found adorable, did more than any argument to compose his agitation. it appealed to his chivalry. he accepted a cup. next she asked for a slice of cake. by the time the cake was eaten and the tea drunk the personal question had lapsed, and they were discussing poetry. insensibly they turned from the question of dramatic poetry in general, to the particular example which reposed in william's pocket, and when the maid came in to clear away the tea-things, william had asked permission to read a short passage aloud, "
Match 2501: "  cassandra bent her head in silence, but she showed a little of what she felt in her eyes, and thus fortified, william felt confident that it would take more than mrs. milvain herself to rout him from his position. he read aloud.  meanwhile katharine walked rapidly along the street. if called upon to explain her impulsive action in leaving the tea-table, she could have traced it to no better cause than that william had glanced at cassandra; cassandra at william. yet, because they had glanced, her position was impossible. if one forgot to pour out a cup of tea they rushed to the conclusion that she was engaged to ralph denham. she knew that in half an hour or so the door would open, and ralph denham would appear. she could not sit there and contemplate seeing him with william's and cassandra's eyes upon them, judging their exact degree of intimacy, so that they might fix the wedding-day. she promptly decided that she would meet ralph out of doors; she still had time to reach lincoln's inn fields before he left his office. she hailed a cab, and bade it take her to a shop for selling maps which she remembered in great queen street, since she hardly liked to be set down at his door. arrived at the shop, she bought a large scale map of norfolk, and thus provided, hurried into lincoln's inn fields, and assured herself of the position of messrs. hoper and grateley's office. the great gas chandeliers were alight in the office windows. she conceived that he sat at an enormous table laden with papers beneath one of them in the front room with the three tall windows. having settled his position there, she began walking to and fro upon the pavement. nobody of his build appeared. she scrutinized each male figure as it approached and passed her. each male figure had, nevertheless, a look of him, due, perhaps, to the professional dress, the quick step, the keen glance which they cast upon her as they hastened home after the day's work. the square itself, with its immense houses all so fully occupied and stern of aspect, its atmosphere of industry and power, as if even the sparrows and the children were earning their daily bread, as if the sky itself, with its gray and scarlet clouds, reflected the serious intention of the city beneath it, spoke of him. here was the fit place for their meeting, she thought; here was the fit place for her to walk thinking of him. she could not help comparing it with the domestic streets of chelsea. with this comparison in her mind, she extended her range a little, and turned into the main road. the great torrent of vans and carts was sweeping down kingsway; pedestrians were streaming in two currents along the pavements. she stood fascinated at the corner. the deep roar filled her ears; the changing tumult had the inexpressible fascination of varied life pouring ceaselessly with a purpose which, as she looked, seemed to her, somehow, the normal purpose for which life was framed; its complete indifference to the individuals, whom it swallowed up and rolled onwards, filled her with at least a temporary exaltation. the blend of daylight and of lamplight made her an invisible spectator, just as it gave the people who passed her a semi-transparent quality, and left the faces pale ivory ovals in which the eyes alone were dark. they tended the enormous rush of the current--the great flow, the deep stream, the unquenchable tide. she stood unobserved and absorbed, glorying openly in the rapture that had run subterraneously all day. suddenly she was clutched, unwilling, from the outside, by the recollection of her purpose in coming there. she had come to find ralph denham. she hastily turned back into lincoln's inn fields, and looked for her landmark--the light in the three tall windows. she sought in vain. the faces of the houses had now merged in the general darkness, and she had difficulty in determining which she sought. ralph's three windows gave back on their ghostly glass panels only a reflection of the gray and greenish sky. she rang the bell, peremptorily, under the painted name of the firm. after some delay she was answered by a caretaker, whose pail and brush of themselves told her that the working day was over and the workers gone. nobody, save perhaps mr. grateley himself, was left, she assured katharine; every one else had been gone these ten minutes.  the news woke katharine completely. anxiety gained upon her. she hastened back into kingsway, looking at people who had miraculously regained their solidity. she ran as far as the tube station, overhauling clerk after clerk, solicitor after solicitor. not one of them even faintly resembled ralph denham. more and more plainly did she see him; and more and more did he seem to her unlike any one else. at the door of the station she paused, and tried to collect her thoughts. he had gone to her house. by taking a cab she could be there probably in advance of him. but she pictured herself opening the drawing-room door, and william and cassandra looking up, and ralph's entrance a moment later, and the glances--the insinuations. no; she could not face it. she would write him a letter and take it at once to his house. she bought paper and pencil at the bookstall, and entered an a.b.c. shop, where, by ordering a cup of coffee, she secured an empty table, and began at vice to write:  "
Match 2502: " here she paused. "
Match 2503: " she substituted, "
Match 2504: " her wants were so vast, now that she was in communication with ralph, that the pencil was utterly inadequate to conduct them on to the paper; it seemed as if the whole torrent of kingsway had to run down her pencil. she gazed intently at a notice hanging on the gold-encrusted wall opposite, "
Match 2505: " she added, writing each word with the painstaking of a child. but, when she raised her eyes again to meditate the next sentence, she was aware of a waitress, whose expression intimated that it was closing time, and, looking round, katharine saw herself almost the last person left in the shop. she took up her letter, paid her bill, and found herself once more in the street. she would now take a cab to highgate. but at that moment it flashed upon her that she could not remember the address. this check seemed to let fall a barrier across a very powerful current of desire. she ransacked her memory in desperation, hunting for the name, first by remembering the look of the house, and then by trying, in memory, to retrace the words she had written once, at least, upon an envelope. the more she pressed the farther the words receded. was the house an orchard something, on the street a hill? she gave it up. never, since she was a child, had she felt anything like this blankness and desolation. there rushed in upon her, as if she were waking from some dream, all the consequences of her inexplicable indolence. she figured ralph's face as he turned from her door without a word of explanation, receiving his dismissal as a blow from herself, a callous intimation that she did not wish to see him. she followed his departure from her door; but it was far more easy to see him marching far and fast in any direction for any length of time than to conceive that he would turn back to highgate. perhaps he would try once more to see her in cheyne walk? it was proof of the clearness with which she saw him, that she started forward as this possibility occurred to her, and almost raised her hand to beckon to a cab. no; he was too proud to come again; he rejected the desire and walked on and on, on and on--if only she could read the names of those visionary streets down which he passed! but her imagination betrayed her at this point, or mocked her with a sense of their strangeness, darkness, and distance. indeed, instead of helping herself to any decision, she only filled her mind with the vast extent of london and the impossibility of finding any single figure that wandered off this way and that way, turned to the right and to the left, chose that dingy little back street where the children were playing in the road, and so--she roused herself impatiently. she walked rapidly along holborn. soon she turned and walked as rapidly in the other direction. this indecision was not merely odious, but had something that alarmed her about it, as she had been alarmed slightly once or twice already that day; she felt unable to cope with the strength of her own desires. to a person controlled by habit, there was humiliation as well as alarm in this sudden release of what appeared to be a very powerful as well as an unreasonable force. an aching in the muscles of her right hand now showed her that she was crushing her gloves and the map of norfolk in a grip sufficient to crack a more solid object. she relaxed her grasp; she looked anxiously at the faces of the passers-by to see whether their eyes rested on her for a moment longer than was natural, or with any curiosity. but having smoothed out her gloves, and done what she could to look as usual, she forgot spectators, and was once more given up to her desperate desire to find ralph denham. it was a desire now--wild, irrational, unexplained, resembling something felt in childhood. once more she blamed herself bitterly for her carelessness. but finding herself opposite the tube station, she pulled herself up and took counsel swiftly, as of old. it flashed upon her that she would go at once to mary datchet, and ask her to give her ralph's address. the decision was a relief, not only in giving her a goal, but in providing her with a rational excuse for her own actions. it gave her a goal certainly, but the fact of having a goal led her to dwell exclusively upon her obsession; so that when she rang the bell of mary's flat, she did not for a moment consider how this demand would strike mary. to her extreme annoyance mary was not at home; a charwoman opened the door. all katharine could do was to accept the invitation to wait. she waited for, perhaps, fifteen minutes, and spent them in pacing from one end of the room to the other without intermission. when she heard mary's key in the door she paused in front of the fireplace, and mary found her standing upright, looking at once expectant and determined, like a person who has come on an errand of such importance that it must be broached without preface.  mary exclaimed in surprise.  "
Match 2506: " katharine said, brushing these remarks aside, as if they were in the way.  "
Match 2507: "  "
Match 2508: " she said, thinking that she had had tea hundreds of years ago, somewhere or other.  mary paused, took off her gloves, and, finding matches, proceeded to light the fire.  katharine checked her with an impatient movement, and said:  "
Match 2509: "  she was holding a pencil and preparing to write on the envelope. she waited with an imperious expression.  "
Match 2510: " mary said, speaking slowly and rather strangely.  "
Match 2511: " katharine exclaimed, with irritation at her own stupidity. "
Match 2512: " she gathered up her purse and gloves and seemed about to go.  "
Match 2513: " said mary, pausing with a match in her hand. katharine, who had already turned towards the door, stopped and looked at her.  "
Match 2514: " she asked.  "
Match 2515: "  "
Match 2516: " she replied. "
Match 2517: "  mary took in the situation at her leisure.  "
Match 2518: " she said.  katharine immediately dropped all that she was holding; her strained expression relaxed, and exclaiming, "
Match 2519: " she seized the telephone receiver and gave her number. mary looked at her steadily, and then left the room. at length katharine heard, through all the superimposed weight of london, the mysterious sound of feet in her own house mounting to the little room, where she could almost see the pictures and the books; she listened with extreme intentness to the preparatory vibrations, and then established her identity.

Match 2522: "  "
Match 2523: "  "
Match 2524: "  "
Match 2525: "  katharine hung up the receiver. she walked the length of the room in such acute disappointment that she did not at first perceive mary's absence. then she called in a harsh and peremptory tone:  "
Match 2526: "  mary was taking off her outdoor things in the bedroom. she heard katharine call her. "
Match 2527: " she said, "
Match 2528: " but the moment prolonged itself, as if for some reason mary found satisfaction in making herself not only tidy, but seemly and ornamented. a stage in her life had been accomplished in the last months which left its traces for ever upon her bearing. youth, and the bloom of youth, had receded, leaving the purpose of her face to show itself in the hollower cheeks, the firmer lips, the eyes no longer spontaneously observing at random, but narrowed upon an end which was not near at hand. this woman was now a serviceable human being, mistress of her own destiny, and thus, by some combination of ideas, fit to be adorned with the dignity of silver chains and glowing brooches. she came in at her leisure and asked: "
Match 2529: "  "
Match 2530: " katharine replied.  "
Match 2531: " said mary.  katharine was once more irresistibly drawn to gaze upon an imaginary map of london, to follow the twists and turns of unnamed streets.  "
Match 2532: " mary crossed to the telephone and, after a series of brief remarks, announced:  "
Match 2533: "  "
Match 2534: " she applied her ear to the telephone once more. "
Match 2535: "  "
Match 2536: "  very pale, and with her large eyes fixed not so much upon mary as upon vistas of unresponding blankness, katharine addressed herself also not so much to mary as to the unrelenting spirit which now appeared to mock her from every quarter of her survey.  after waiting a little time mary remarked indifferently:  "
Match 2537: " slackly lying back in her armchair, she watched the little flames beginning to creep among the coals indifferently, as if they, too, were very distant and indifferent.  katharine looked at her indignantly and rose.  "
Match 2538: " mary continued, without altering the abstract tone of her voice. "
Match 2539: " she bent forward and touched the wood, so that the flames slipped in between the interstices of the coal.  katharine reflected. "
Match 2540: " she said.  mary rose, went to the table, spread out her papers under the green-shaded lamp and, with an action that was becoming a habit, twisted a lock of hair round and round in her fingers. once she looked unperceived at her visitor, who never moved, who sat so still, with eyes so intent, that you could almost fancy that she was watching something, some face that never looked up at her. mary found herself unable to go on writing. she turned her eyes away, but only to be aware of the presence of what katharine looked at. there were ghosts in the room, and one, strangely and sadly, was the ghost of herself. the minutes went by.  "
Match 2541: " said katharine at last. the half-hour was not quite spent.  "
Match 2542: " said mary, rising from her table.  "
Match 2543: " said katharine.  "
Match 2544: "  katharine looked round the room, conveying her uncertainty in her glance.  "
Match 2545: " she mused.  "
Match 2546: "  mary spoke, and intended to speak, cruelly enough.  "
Match 2547: " katharine replied.  their eyes met with antagonism, and neither flinched.  "
Match 2548: " mary answered.  a loud knocking at the door interrupted them. mary went to open it, and returning with some note or parcel, katharine looked away so that mary might not read her disappointment.  "
Match 2549: " mary repeated, laying the note upon the table.  "
Match 2550: " said katharine. "
Match 2551: "  she spoke with a self-abandonment that mary had never seen in her.  "
Match 2552: " she said roughly.  "
Match 2553: "  "
Match 2554: " mary interrupted her. "
Match 2555: "  "
Match 2556: " katharine exclaimed. "
Match 2557: "  her look, passing beyond mary, beyond the verge of the room and out beyond any words that came her way, wildly and passionately, convinced mary that she, at any rate, could not follow such a glance to its end. she was baffled; she tried to think herself back again into the height of her love for ralph. pressing her fingers upon her eyelids, she murmured:  "
Match 2558: "  and yet, what had she known? she could not remember it any more. she pressed her eyeballs until they struck stars and suns into her darkness. she convinced herself that she was stirring among ashes. she desisted. she was astonished at her discovery. she did not love ralph any more. she looked back dazed into the room, and her eyes rested upon the table with its lamp-lit papers. the steady radiance seemed for a second to have its counterpart within her; she shut her eyes; she opened them and looked at the lamp again; another love burnt in the place of the old one, or so, in a momentary glance of amazement, she guessed before the revelation was over and the old surroundings asserted themselves. she leant in silence against the mantelpiece.  "
Match 2559: " she murmured, half to herself, at length.  katharine made no reply and seemed unaware of her words. she seemed absorbed in her own thoughts.  "
Match 2560: " she exclaimed. "
Match 2561: "  "
Match 2562: " said mary, and katharine, after considering for a moment, said:  "
Match 2563: "  she sank down into her chair again, and took up the same position which mary had compared to the position of one watching an unseeing face. she watched, indeed, not a face, but a procession, not of people, but of life itself: the good and bad; the meaning; the past, the present, and the future. all this seemed apparent to her, and she was not ashamed of her extravagance so much as exalted to one of the pinnacles of existence, where it behoved the world to do her homage. no one but she herself knew what it meant to miss ralph denham on that particular night; into this inadequate event crowded feelings that the great crises of life might have failed to call forth. she had missed him, and knew the bitterness of all failure; she desired him, and knew the torment of all passion. it did not matter what trivial accidents led to this culmination. nor did she care how extravagant she appeared, nor how openly she showed her feelings.  when the dinner was ready mary told her to come, and she came submissively, as if she let mary direct her movements for her. they ate and drank together almost in silence, and when mary told her to eat more, she ate more; when she was told to drink wine, she drank it. nevertheless, beneath this superficial obedience, mary knew that she was following her own thoughts unhindered. she was not inattentive so much as remote; she looked at once so unseeing and so intent upon some vision of her own that mary gradually felt more than protective--she became actually alarmed at the prospect of some collision between katharine and the forces of the outside world. directly they had done, katharine announced her intention of going.  "
Match 2564: " mary asked, desiring vaguely to hinder her.  "
Match 2565: "  mary saw that it would be useless to try to stop her. all she could do was to insist upon coming too, but she met with no opposition; katharine seemed indifferent to her presence. in a few minutes they were walking along the strand. they walked so rapidly that mary was deluded into the belief that katharine knew where she was going. she herself was not attentive. she was glad of the movement along lamp-lit streets in the open air. she was fingering, painfully and with fear, yet with strange hope, too, the discovery which she had stumbled upon unexpectedly that night. she was free once more at the cost of a gift, the best, perhaps, that she could offer, but she was, thank heaven, in love no longer. she was tempted to spend the first instalment of her freedom in some dissipation; in the pit of the coliseum, for example, since they were now passing the door. why not go in and celebrate her independence of the tyranny of love? or, perhaps, the top of an omnibus bound for some remote place such as camberwell, or sidcup, or the welsh harp would suit her better. she noticed these names painted on little boards for the first time for weeks. or should she return to her room, and spend the night working out the details of a very enlightened and ingenious scheme? of all possibilities this appealed to her most, and brought to mind the fire, the lamplight, the steady glow which had seemed lit in the place where a more passionate flame had once burnt.  now katharine stopped, and mary woke to the fact that instead of having a goal she had evidently none. she paused at the edge of the crossing, and looked this way and that, and finally made as if in the direction of haverstock hill.  "
Match 2566: " mary cried, catching her by the hand. "
Match 2567: " she hailed a cab and insisted that katharine should get in, while she directed the driver to take them to cheyne walk.  katharine submitted. "
Match 2568: " she said. "
Match 2569: "  a gloom seemed to have fallen on her. she lay back in her corner, silent and apparently exhausted. mary, in spite of her own preoccupation, was struck by her pallor and her attitude of dejection.  "
Match 2570: " she said more gently than she had yet spoken.  "
Match 2571: " katharine replied. without understanding her, mary began to pity her for what she was suffering.  "
Match 2572: " she said, taking her hand and rubbing it. "
Match 2573: "  "
Match 2574: "  she leant forward and looked out of the window.  "
Match 2575: " she said in a low voice, almost to herself.  the exaggeration was so immense that mary did not attempt to cope with it, save by keeping hold of katharine's wrist. she half expected that katharine might open the door suddenly and jump out. perhaps katharine perceived the purpose with which her hand was held.  "
Match 2576: " she said, with a little laugh. "
Match 2577: "  upon this, mary ostentatiously withdrew her hand.  "
Match 2578: " katharine continued, with an effort, "
Match 2579: " she sprang forward to catch sight of a clock, as if the exact time had some important bearing on her case.  "
Match 2580: " she exclaimed. "
Match 2581: " she leant out of the window and told the cabman to drive faster.  "
Match 2582: "  "
Match 2583: " mary repeated.  mary had no doubt but that somehow or other they would find him. but suppose they did find him? she began to think of ralph with a sort of strangeness, in her effort to understand how he could be capable of satisfying this extraordinary desire. once more she thought herself back to her old view of him and could, with an effort, recall the haze which surrounded his figure, and the sense of confused, heightened exhilaration which lay all about his neighborhood, so that for months at a time she had never exactly heard his voice or seen his face--or so it now seemed to her. the pain of her loss shot through her. nothing would ever make up--not success, or happiness, or oblivion. but this pang was immediately followed by the assurance that now, at any rate, she knew the truth; and katharine, she thought, stealing a look at her, did not know the truth; yes, katharine was immensely to be pitied.  the cab, which had been caught in the traffic, was now liberated and sped on down sloane street. mary was conscious of the tension with which katharine marked its progress, as if her mind were fixed upon a point in front of them, and marked, second by second, their approach to it. she said nothing, and in silence mary began to fix her mind, in sympathy at first, and later in forgetfulness of her companion, upon a point in front of them. she imagined a point distant as a low star upon the horizon of the dark. there for her too, for them both, was the goal for which they were striving, and the end for the ardors of their spirits was the same: but where it was, or what it was, or why she felt convinced that they were united in search of it, as they drove swiftly down the streets of london side by side, she could not have said.  "
Match 2584: " katharine breathed, as the cab drew up at the door. she jumped out and scanned the pavement on either side. mary, meanwhile, rang the bell. the door opened as katharine assured herself that no one of the people within view had any likeness to ralph. on seeing her, the maid said at once:  "
Match 2585: "  katharine vanished from mary's sight. the door shut between them, and mary walked slowly and thoughtfully up the street alone.  katharine turned at once to the dining-room. but with her fingers upon the handle, she held back. perhaps she realized that this was a moment which would never come again. perhaps, for a second, it seemed to her that no reality could equal the imagination she had formed. perhaps she was restrained by some vague fear or anticipation, which made her dread any exchange or interruption. but if these doubts and fears or this supreme bliss restrained her, it was only for a moment. in another second she had turned the handle and, biting her lip to control herself, she opened the door upon ralph denham. an extraordinary clearness of sight seemed to possess her on beholding him. so little, so single, so separate from all else he appeared, who had been the cause of these extreme agitations and aspirations. she could have laughed in his face. but, gaining upon this clearness of sight against her will, and to her dislike, was a flood of confusion, of relief, of certainty, of humility, of desire no longer to strive and to discriminate, yielding to which, she let herself sink within his arms and confessed her love.    chapter xxxii  nobody asked katharine any questions next day. if cross-examined she might have said that nobody spoke to her. she worked a little, wrote a little, ordered the dinner, and sat, for longer than she knew, with her head on her hand piercing whatever lay before her, whether it was a letter or a dictionary, as if it were a film upon the deep prospects that revealed themselves to her kindling and brooding eyes. she rose once, and going to the bookcase, took out her father's greek dictionary and spread the sacred pages of symbols and figures before her. she smoothed the sheets with a mixture of affectionate amusement and hope. would other eyes look on them with her one day? the thought, long intolerable, was now just bearable.  she was quite unaware of the anxiety with which her movements were watched and her expression scanned. cassandra was careful not to be caught looking at her, and their conversation was so prosaic that were it not for certain jolts and jerks between the sentences, as if the mind were kept with difficulty to the rails, mrs. milvain herself could have detected nothing of a suspicious nature in what she overheard.  william, when he came in late that afternoon and found cassandra alone, had a very serious piece of news to impart. he had just passed katharine in the street and she had failed to recognize him.  "
Match 2586: "--he hesitated--"
Match 2587: "  to cassandra the significant thing was that katharine had gone out without telling her, and she interpreted this to mean that she had gone out to meet ralph denham. but to her surprise william drew no comfort from this probability.  "
Match 2588: " he began, "
Match 2589: " and the fact that you are going to meet a young man is no longer proof of anything, except, indeed, that people will talk.  cassandra saw, not without a pang of jealousy, that he was extremely solicitous that people should not talk about katharine, as if his interest in her were still proprietary rather than friendly. as they were both ignorant of ralph's visit the night before they had not that reason to comfort themselves with the thought that matters were hastening to a crisis. these absences of katharine's, moreover, left them exposed to interruptions which almost destroyed their pleasure in being alone together. the rainy evening made it impossible to go out; and, indeed, according to william's code, it was considerably more damning to be seen out of doors than surprised within. they were so much at the mercy of bells and doors that they could hardly talk of macaulay with any conviction, and william preferred to defer the second act of his tragedy until another day.  under these circumstances cassandra showed herself at her best. she sympathized with william's anxieties and did her utmost to share them; but still, to be alone together, to be running risks together, to be partners in the wonderful conspiracy, was to her so enthralling that she was always forgetting discretion, breaking out into exclamations and admirations which finally made william believe that, although deplorable and upsetting, the situation was not without its sweetness.  when the door did open, he started, but braved the forthcoming revelation. it was not mrs. milvain, however, but katharine herself who entered, closely followed by ralph denham. with a set expression which showed what an effort she was making, katharine encountered their eyes, and saying, "
Match 2590: " she led denham behind the curtain which hung in front of the room with the relics. this refuge was none of her willing, but confronted with wet pavements and only some belated museum or tube station for shelter, she was forced, for ralph's sake, to face the discomforts of her own house. under the street lamps she had thought him looking both tired and strained.  thus separated, the two couples remained occupied for some time with their own affairs. only the lowest murmurs penetrated from one section of the room to the other. at length the maid came in to bring a message that mr. hilbery would not be home for dinner. it was true that there was no need that katharine should be informed, but william began to inquire cassandra's opinion in such a way as to show that, with or without reason, he wished very much to speak to her.  from motives of her own cassandra dissuaded him.  "
Match 2591: " he hazarded. "
Match 2592: " the coupling of their names in this manner caused cassandra's heart to leap with pleasure.  "
Match 2593: " she began, but william hastily took her up.  "
Match 2594: "  he proceeded on his embassy with a mixture of excitement and embarrassment which caused him to turn aside with his hand on the curtain, and to examine intently for several moments the portrait of a lady, optimistically said by mrs. hilbery to be an early work of sir joshua reynolds. then, with some unnecessary fumbling, he drew aside the curtain, and with his eyes fixed upon the ground, repeated his message and suggested that they should all spend the evening at the play. katharine accepted the suggestion with such cordiality that it was strange to find her of no clear mind as to the precise spectacle she wished to see. she left the choice entirely to ralph and william, who, taking counsel fraternally over an evening paper, found themselves in agreement as to the merits of a music-hall. this being arranged, everything else followed easily and enthusiastically. cassandra had never been to a music-hall. katharine instructed her in the peculiar delights of an entertainment where polar bears follow directly upon ladies in full evening dress, and the stage is alternately a garden of mystery, a milliner's band-box, and a fried-fish shop in the mile end road. whatever the exact nature of the program that night, it fulfilled the highest purposes of dramatic art, so far, at least, as four of the audience were concerned.  no doubt the actors and the authors would have been surprised to learn in what shape their efforts reached those particular eyes and ears; but they could not have denied that the effect as a whole was tremendous. the hall resounded with brass and strings, alternately of enormous pomp and majesty, and then of sweetest lamentation. the reds and creams of the background, the lyres and harps and urns and skulls, the protuberances of plaster, the fringes of scarlet plush, the sinking and blazing of innumerable electric lights, could scarcely have been surpassed for decorative effect by any craftsman of the ancient or modern world.  then there was the audience itself, bare-shouldered, tufted and garlanded in the stalls, decorous but festal in the balconies, and frankly fit for daylight and street life in the galleries. but, however they differed when looked at separately, they shared the same huge, lovable nature in the bulk, which murmured and swayed and quivered all the time the dancing and juggling and love-making went on in front of it, slowly laughed and reluctantly left off laughing, and applauded with a helter-skelter generosity which sometimes became unanimous and overwhelming. once william saw katharine leaning forward and clapping her hands with an abandonment that startled him. her laugh rang out with the laughter of the audience.  for a second he was puzzled, as if this laughter disclosed something that he had never suspected in her. but then cassandra's face caught his eye, gazing with astonishment at the buffoon, not laughing, too deeply intent and surprised to laugh at what she saw, and for some moments he watched her as if she were a child.  the performance came to an end, the illusion dying out first here and then there, as some rose to put on their coats, others stood upright to salute "
Match 2595: " the musicians folded their music and encased their instruments, and the lights sank one by one until the house was empty, silent, and full of great shadows. looking back over her shoulder as she followed ralph through the swing doors, cassandra marveled to see how the stage was already entirely without romance. but, she wondered, did they really cover all the seats in brown holland every night?  the success of this entertainment was such that before they separated another expedition had been planned for the next day. the next day was saturday; therefore both william and ralph were free to devote the whole afternoon to an expedition to greenwich, which cassandra had never seen, and katharine confused with dulwich. on this occasion ralph was their guide. he brought them without accident to greenwich.  what exigencies of state or fantasies of imagination first gave birth to the cluster of pleasant places by which london is surrounded is matter of indifference now that they have adapted themselves so admirably to the needs of people between the ages of twenty and thirty with saturday afternoons to spend. indeed, if ghosts have any interest in the affections of those who succeed them they must reap their richest harvests when the fine weather comes again and the lovers, the sightseers, and the holiday-makers pour themselves out of trains and omnibuses into their old pleasure-grounds. it is true that they go, for the most part, unthanked by name, although upon this occasion william was ready to give such discriminating praise as the dead architects and painters received seldom in the course of the year. they were walking by the river bank, and katharine and ralph, lagging a little behind, caught fragments of his lecture. katharine smiled at the sound of his voice; she listened as if she found it a little unfamiliar, intimately though she knew it; she tested it. the note of assurance and happiness was new. william was very happy. she learnt every hour what sources of his happiness she had neglected. she had never asked him to teach her anything; she had never consented to read macaulay; she had never expressed her belief that his play was second only to the works of shakespeare. she followed dreamily in their wake, smiling and delighting in the sound which conveyed, she knew, the rapturous and yet not servile assent of cassandra.  then she murmured, "
Match 2596: " but changed her sentence to the opposite of what she meant to say and ended, "
Match 2597: " but it was unnecessary to follow out such riddles when the presence of ralph supplied her with more interesting problems, which somehow became involved with the little boat crossing the river, the majestic and careworn city, and the steamers homecoming with their treasury, or starting in search of it, so that infinite leisure would be necessary for the proper disentanglement of one from the other. he stopped, moreover, and began inquiring of an old boatman as to the tides and the ships. in thus talking he seemed different, and even looked different, she thought, against the river, with the steeples and towers for background. his strangeness, his romance, his power to leave her side and take part in the affairs of men, the possibility that they should together hire a boat and cross the river, the speed and wildness of this enterprise filled her mind and inspired her with such rapture, half of love and half of adventure, that william and cassandra were startled from their talk, and cassandra exclaimed, "
Match 2598: " she added quickly, though she repressed, in deference to william, her own wonder that the sight of ralph denham talking to a boatman on the banks of the thames could move any one to such an attitude of adoration.  that afternoon, what with tea and the curiosities of the thames tunnel and the unfamiliarity of the streets, passed so quickly that the only method of prolonging it was to plan another expedition for the following day. hampton court was decided upon, in preference to hampstead, for though cassandra had dreamt as a child of the brigands of hampstead, she had now transferred her affections completely and for ever to william iii. accordingly, they arrived at hampton court about lunch-time on a fine sunday morning. such unity marked their expressions of admiration for the red-brick building that they might have come there for no other purpose than to assure each other that this palace was the stateliest palace in the world. they walked up and down the terrace, four abreast, and fancied themselves the owners of the place, and calculated the amount of good to the world produced indubitably by such a tenancy.  "
Match 2599: " said katharine, "
Match 2600: "  "
Match 2601: " cassandra began, but checked herself from the liberty of envisaging katharine as the widow of a distinguished lawyer. upon this, the third day of junketing, it was tiresome to have to restrain oneself even from such innocent excursions of fancy. she dared not question william; he was inscrutable; he never seemed even to follow the other couple with curiosity when they separated, as they frequently did, to name a plant, or examine a fresco. cassandra was constantly studying their backs. she noticed how sometimes the impulse to move came from katharine, and sometimes from ralph; how, sometimes, they walked slow, as if in profound intercourse, and sometimes fast, as if in passionate. when they came together again nothing could be more unconcerned than their manner.  "
Match 2602: " or, "
Match 2603: " then, to puzzle her further, william and ralph filled in all interstices of meal-times or railway journeys with perfectly good-tempered arguments; or they discussed politics, or they told stories, or they did sums together upon the backs of old envelopes to prove something. she suspected that katharine was absent-minded, but it was impossible to tell. there were moments when she felt so young and inexperienced that she almost wished herself back with the silkworms at stogdon house, and not embarked upon this bewildering intrigue.  these moments, however, were only the necessary shadow or chill which proved the substance of her bliss, and did not damage the radiance which seemed to rest equally upon the whole party. the fresh air of spring, the sky washed of clouds and already shedding warmth from its blue, seemed the reply vouchsafed by nature to the mood of her chosen spirits. these chosen spirits were to be found also among the deer, dumbly basking, and among the fish, set still in mid-stream, for they were mute sharers in a benignant state not needing any exposition by the tongue. no words that cassandra could come by expressed the stillness, the brightness, the air of expectancy which lay upon the orderly beauty of the grass walks and gravel paths down which they went walking four abreast that sunday afternoon. silently the shadows of the trees lay across the broad sunshine; silence wrapt her heart in its folds. the quivering stillness of the butterfly on the half-opened flower, the silent grazing of the deer in the sun, were the sights her eye rested upon and received as the images of her own nature laid open to happiness and trembling in its ecstasy.  but the afternoon wore on, and it became time to leave the gardens. as they drove from waterloo to chelsea, katharine began to have some compunction about her father, which, together with the opening of offices and the need of working in them on monday, made it difficult to plan another festival for the following day. mr. hilbery had taken their absence, so far, with paternal benevolence, but they could not trespass upon it indefinitely. indeed, had they known it, he was already suffering from their absence, and longing for their return.  he had no dislike of solitude, and sunday, in particular, was pleasantly adapted for letter-writing, paying calls, or a visit to his club. he was leaving the house on some such suitable expedition towards tea-time when he found himself stopped on his own doorstep by his sister, mrs. milvain. she should, on hearing that no one was at home, have withdrawn submissively, but instead she accepted his half-hearted invitation to come in, and he found himself in the melancholy position of being forced to order tea for her and sit in the drawing-room while she drank it. she speedily made it plain that she was only thus exacting because she had come on a matter of business. he was by no means exhilarated at the news.  "
Match 2604: " he remarked. "
Match 2605: "  "
Match 2606: "  "
Match 2607: " he turned his stone between his fingers, and conceived different methods of leading celia away from her obsession, which, he supposed, must have reference to the domestic affairs of cyril as usual.  "
Match 2608: " mrs. milvain repeated significantly. "
Match 2609: "  "
Match 2610: " mr. hilbery agreed urbanely, pleased at the diversion. "
Match 2611: " he was prepared to dwell at some length upon this safe topic, and trusted that katharine would come in before he had done with it.  "
Match 2612: " mr. hilbery continued. "
Match 2613: "  her brother's affability did not deceive mrs. milvain; it slightly saddened her; she well knew the cause of it. blind and infatuated as usual!  "
Match 2614: " she asked.  "
Match 2615: " said mr. hilbery, in relief that her mind had taken this turn. "
Match 2616: "  "
Match 2617: " mrs. milvain interposed.  "
Match 2618: "  "
Match 2619: "  "
Match 2620: " said mr. hilbery, who was prepared to draw upon his imagination, if necessary, to keep mrs. milvain supplied with facts about the private history of ralph denham since, for some inscrutable reason, the subject took her fancy.  "
Match 2621: "  "
Match 2622: " mrs. milvain inquired. "
Match 2623: "  mr. hilbery shook his head. "
Match 2624: " he observed. "
Match 2625: " he added. the remark sounded to his ears unfortunately conclusive, and he was afraid that there was nothing more to be said about denham. he examined the tips of his fingers carefully. "
Match 2626: " he started afresh. "
Match 2627: "  mrs. milvain had given her cup a little push, which seemed to indicate some momentary displeasure. but she did not want any more tea.  "
Match 2628: " she began. "
Match 2629: "  mr. hilbery looked taken aback, and was silent for a second.  "
Match 2630: " he remarked urbanely, continuing his examination of his finger-nails. "
Match 2631: "  mrs. milvain became rigid, and emitted her message in little short sentences of extreme intensity.  "
Match 2632: "  there was another slight pause.  "
Match 2633: " mr. hilbery replied imperturbably. "
Match 2634: "  mrs. milvain rose at once.  "
Match 2635: " she repeated. she stood very erect with the dauntless air of one testifying to the truth regardless of consequences. she knew from past discussions that the only way to counter her brother's indolence and indifference was to shoot her statements at him in a compressed form once finally upon leaving the room. having spoken thus, she restrained herself from adding another word, and left the house with the dignity of one inspired by a great ideal.  she had certainly framed her remarks in such a way as to prevent her brother from paying his call in the region of knightsbridge. he had no fears for katharine, but there was a suspicion at the back of his mind that cassandra might have been, innocently and ignorantly, led into some foolish situation in one of their unshepherded dissipations. his wife was an erratic judge of the conventions; he himself was lazy; and with katharine absorbed, very naturally--here he recalled, as well as he could, the exact nature of the charge. "
Match 2636: " from which it appeared that katharine was not absorbed, or which of them was it that had entangled herself with ralph denham? from this maze of absurdity mr. hilbery saw no way out until katharine herself came to his help, so that he applied himself, very philosophically on the whole, to a book.  no sooner had he heard the young people come in and go upstairs than he sent a maid to tell miss katharine that he wished to speak to her in the study. she was slipping furs loosely onto the floor in the drawing-room in front of the fire. they were all gathered round, reluctant to part. the message from her father surprised katharine, and the others caught from her look, as she turned to go, a vague sense of apprehension.  mr. hilbery was reassured by the sight of her. he congratulated himself, he prided himself, upon possessing a daughter who had a sense of responsibility and an understanding of life profound beyond her years. moreover, she was looking to-day unusual; he had come to take her beauty for granted; now he remembered it and was surprised by it. he thought instinctively that he had interrupted some happy hour of hers with rodney, and apologized.  "
Match 2637: "  katharine did not reply at once, and mr. hilbery tapped the coal encouragingly with the poker. then she said, without embarrassment or apology:  "
Match 2638: "  mr. hilbery was relieved and secretly amused at the thought of the interview, although he could not license such irreverence outwardly.  "
Match 2639: "  she did not respond, as he had hoped, with any affectionate or humorous reply. she meditated, pondering something or other, and he reflected that even his katharine did not differ from other women in the capacity to let things be. or had she something to say?  "
Match 2640: " he inquired lightly. "
Match 2641: " he said more seriously, struck by something in the expression of her eyes.  "
Match 2642: " she said, "
Match 2643: "  "
Match 2644: " he exclaimed, dropping the poker in his immense surprise. "
Match 2645: "  "
Match 2646: " katharine spoke hurriedly and indifferently, as if the matter could no longer concern any one.  "
Match 2647: "  "
Match 2648: "  "
Match 2649: "  "
Match 2650: "  mr. hilbery had seldom felt more completely at a loss. he thought that katharine was treating the matter with curious unconcern; she scarcely seemed aware of the gravity of what she was saying; he did not understand the position at all. but his desire to smooth everything over comfortably came to his relief. no doubt there was some quarrel, some whimsey on the part of william, who, though a good fellow, was a little exacting sometimes--something that a woman could put right. but though he inclined to take the easiest view of his responsibilities, he cared too much for this daughter to let things be.  "
Match 2651: " he said irritably. "
Match 2652: "  "
Match 2653: " said katharine. "
Match 2654: " she added. "
Match 2655: "  this appeal for delay was much to mr. hilbery's liking. but his conscience would not suffer it. people were talking. he could not endure that his daughter's conduct should be in any way considered irregular. he wondered whether, in the circumstances, it would be better to wire to his wife, to send for one of his sisters, to forbid william the house, to pack cassandra off home--for he was vaguely conscious of responsibilities in her direction, too. his forehead was becoming more and more wrinkled by the multiplicity of his anxieties, which he was sorely tempted to ask katharine to solve for him, when the door opened and william rodney appeared. this necessitated a complete change, not only of manner, but of position also.  "
Match 2656: " katharine exclaimed, in a tone of relief. "
Match 2657: " she said to him. "
Match 2658: "  william's manner was marked by the utmost formality. he bowed very slightly in the direction of mr. hilbery, and stood erect, holding one lapel of his coat, and gazing into the center of the fire. he waited for mr. hilbery to speak.  mr. hilbery also assumed an appearance of formidable dignity. he had risen to his feet, and now bent the top part of his body slightly forward.  "
Match 2659: "  william waited two seconds at least.  "
Match 2660: " he said, with the utmost stiffness.  "
Match 2661: "  after a perceptible pause william bent his head, and katharine said, as if by an afterthought:  "
Match 2662: "  mr. hilbery swayed to and fro, and moved his lips as if to utter remarks which remained unspoken.  "
Match 2663: " he began.  "
Match 2664: " katharine interposed. "
Match 2665: " she moved a few paces across the room, as if she intended to leave them. her preoccupied naturalness was in strange contrast to her father's pomposity and to william's military rigidity. he had not once raised his eyes. katharine's glance, on the other hand, ranged past the two gentlemen, along the books, over the tables, towards the door. she was paying the least possible attention, it seemed, to what was happening. her father looked at her with a sudden clouding and troubling of his expression. somehow his faith in her stability and sense was queerly shaken. he no longer felt that he could ultimately entrust her with the whole conduct of her own affairs after a superficial show of directing them. he felt, for the first time in many years, responsible for her.  "
Match 2666: " he said, dropping his formal manner and addressing rodney as if katharine were not present. "
Match 2667: "  he was struck by william's appearance, which seemed to him to indicate profound feeling resolutely held in check. no doubt, he reflected, katharine had been very trying, unconsciously trying, and had driven him to take up a position which was none of his willing. mr. hilbery certainly did not overrate william's sufferings. no minutes in his life had hitherto extorted from him such intensity of anguish. he was now facing the consequences of his insanity. he must confess himself entirely and fundamentally other than mr. hilbery thought him. everything was against him. even the sunday evening and the fire and the tranquil library scene were against him. mr. hilbery's appeal to him as a man of the world was terribly against him. he was no longer a man of any world that mr. hilbery cared to recognize. but some power compelled him, as it had compelled him to come downstairs, to make his stand here and now, alone and unhelped by any one, without prospect of reward. he fumbled with various phrases; and then jerked out:  "
Match 2668: "  mr. hilbery's face turned a curious dull purple. he looked at his daughter. he nodded his head, as if to convey his silent command to her to leave the room; but either she did not notice it or preferred not to obey.  "
Match 2669: " mr. hilbery began, in a dull, low voice that he himself had never heard before, when there was a scuffling and exclaiming in the hall, and cassandra, who appeared to be insisting against some dissuasion on the part of another, burst into the room.  "
Match 2670: " she exclaimed, "
Match 2671: " she flung herself between rodney and her uncle, as if she sought to intercept their blows. as her uncle stood perfectly still, looking very large and imposing, and as nobody spoke, she shrank back a little, and looked first at katharine and then at rodney. "
Match 2672: " she said, a little lamely.  "
Match 2673: " mr. hilbery continued, speaking with complete disregard of cassandra's interruption.  "
Match 2674: " rodney's words, which were broken in sense, spoken after a pause, and with his eyes upon the ground, nevertheless expressed an astonishing amount of resolution. "
Match 2675: " he brought out, looking mr. hilbery directly in the eyes for the first time.  "
Match 2676: " mr. hilbery returned.  "
Match 2677: " said katharine. she moved a little towards rodney, and her movement seemed to testify mutely to her respect for him, and her alliance with him. "
Match 2678: "  cassandra, too, gave an indescribably slight movement which seemed to draw the three of them into alliance together. katharine's tone and glance made mr. hilbery once more feel completely at a loss, and in addition, painfully and angrily obsolete; but in spite of an awful inner hollowness he was outwardly composed.  "
Match 2679: "  he paused, and his pause seemed to signify that he was extremely thankful for his daughter's deliverance.  cassandra turned to katharine, who drew her breath as if to speak and checked herself; rodney, too, seemed to await some movement on her part; her father glanced at her as if he half anticipated some further revelation. she remained perfectly silent. in the silence they heard distinctly steps descending the staircase, and katharine went straight to the door.  "
Match 2680: " mr. hilbery commanded. "
Match 2681: " he added.  she paused, holding the door ajar.  "
Match 2682: " she said, and as she spoke she opened the door and went out. they could hear her immediately speak to some one outside, though the words were inaudible.  mr. hilbery was left confronting the guilty couple, who remained standing as if they did not accept their dismissal, and the disappearance of katharine had brought some change into the situation. so, in his secret heart, mr. hilbery felt that it had, for he could not explain his daughter's behavior to his own satisfaction.  "
Match 2683: " cassandra exclaimed impulsively, "
Match 2684: "  her uncle still refused to acknowledge her identity, and still talked over her head as if she did not exist.  "
Match 2685: " he said to rodney grimly.  "
Match 2686: " cassandra replied for him. "
Match 2687: " she looked appealingly at rodney, who shook his head ever so slightly.  "
Match 2688: " her uncle asked sharply, looking at her at last.  the words died on her lips. it was apparent that she was straining her ears as if to catch some sound outside the room that would come to her help. he received no answer. he listened, too.  "
Match 2689: " he concluded, sinking into his chair again, hunching his shoulders and regarding the flames. he seemed to speak to himself, and rodney and cassandra looked at him in silence.  "
Match 2690: " he said suddenly. he spoke gruffly, but the force of his anger was evidently spent, or some preoccupation had turned his mood to other regions. while cassandra accepted his invitation, rodney remained standing.  "
Match 2691: " he said, and left the room, mr. hilbery giving his assent by a slight nod of the head.  meanwhile, in the dining-room next door, denham and katharine were once more seated at the mahogany table. they seemed to be continuing a conversation broken off in the middle, as if each remembered the precise point at which they had been interrupted, and was eager to go on as quickly as possible. katharine, having interposed a short account of the interview with her father, denham made no comment, but said:  "
Match 2692: "  "
Match 2693: " katharine replied.  "
Match 2694: "  "
Match 2695: "  he sighed impatiently, and said nothing for a moment.  "
Match 2696: " he renewed, "
Match 2697: " he added, his assumption of reason broken up by his agitation, "
Match 2698: "  "
Match 2699: " she exclaimed, as if the subject chafed her, "
Match 2700: " she ejaculated, tapping her finger upon the table as if to emphasize and perhaps explain her isolated utterance of this word. "
Match 2701: "  they were trying to explain, not for the first time, as their weary gestures and frequent interruptions showed, what in their common language they had christened their "
Match 2702: "; a constant source of distress to them, in the past few days, and the immediate reason why ralph was on his way to leave the house when katharine, listening anxiously, heard him and prevented him. what was the cause of these lapses? either because katharine looked more beautiful, or more strange, because she wore something different, or said something unexpected, ralph's sense of her romance welled up and overcame him either into silence or into inarticulate expressions, which katharine, with unintentional but invariable perversity, interrupted or contradicted with some severity or assertion of prosaic fact. then the vision disappeared, and ralph expressed vehemently in his turn the conviction that he only loved her shadow and cared nothing for her reality. if the lapse was on her side it took the form of gradual detachment until she became completely absorbed in her own thoughts, which carried her away with such intensity that she sharply resented any recall to her companion's side. it was useless to assert that these trances were always originated by ralph himself, however little in their later stages they had to do with him. the fact remained that she had no need of him and was very loath to be reminded of him. how, then, could they be in love? the fragmentary nature of their relationship was but too apparent.  thus they sat depressed to silence at the dining-room table, oblivious of everything, while rodney paced the drawing-room overhead in such agitation and exaltation of mind as he had never conceived possible, and cassandra remained alone with her uncle. ralph, at length, rose and walked gloomily to the window. he pressed close to the pane. outside were truth and freedom and the immensity only to be apprehended by the mind in loneliness, and never communicated to another. what worse sacrilege was there than to attempt to violate what he perceived by seeking to impart it? some movement behind him made him reflect that katharine had the power, if she chose, to be in person what he dreamed of her spirit. he turned sharply to implore her help, when again he was struck cold by her look of distance, her expression of intentness upon some far object. as if conscious of his look upon her she rose and came to him, standing close by his side, and looking with him out into the dusky atmosphere. their physical closeness was to him a bitter enough comment upon the distance between their minds. yet distant as she was, her presence by his side transformed the world. he saw himself performing wonderful deeds of courage; saving the drowning, rescuing the forlorn. impatient with this form of egotism, he could not shake off the conviction that somehow life was wonderful, romantic, a master worth serving so long as she stood there. he had no wish that she should speak; he did not look at her or touch her; she was apparently deep in her own thoughts and oblivious of his presence.  the door opened without their hearing the sound. mr. hilbery looked round the room, and for a moment failed to discover the two figures in the window. he started with displeasure when he saw them, and observed them keenly before he appeared able to make up his mind to say anything. he made a movement finally that warned them of his presence; they turned instantly. without speaking, he beckoned to katharine to come to him, and, keeping his eyes from the region of the room where denham stood, he shepherded her in front of him back to the study. when katharine was inside the room he shut the study door carefully behind him as if to secure himself from something that he disliked.  "
Match 2703: " he said, taking up his stand in front of the fire, "
Match 2704: " she remained silent. "
Match 2705: " he said sharply.... "
Match 2706: " he added, as she still said nothing, "
Match 2707: "  "
Match 2708: " she replied.  his sense of relief was great; he had been certain that her answer would have confirmed his suspicions, but that anxiety being set at rest, he was the more conscious of annoyance with her for her behavior.  "
Match 2709: " he went on, his anger rising as he spoke. "
Match 2710: " he broke off, disquieted by the ominous silence with which his words were received, and looked at his daughter with the curious doubt as to her state of mind which he had felt before, for the first time, this evening. he perceived once more that she was not attending to what he said, but was listening, and for a moment he, too, listened for sounds outside the room. his certainty that there was some understanding between denham and katharine returned, but with a most unpleasant suspicion that there was something illicit about it, as the whole position between the young people seemed to him gravely illicit.  "
Match 2711: " he said, on the impulse of his suspicion, moving as if to go.  "
Match 2712: " katharine said instantly, starting forward.  "
Match 2713: " said her father.  "
Match 2714: " she asked.  "
Match 2715: " he returned.  "
Match 2716: " she replied.  at these words, which seemed to imply a determination to go--to go for ever, mr. hilbery returned to his position in front of the fire, and began swaying slightly from side to side without for the moment making any remark.  "
Match 2717: " he said at length, fixing his eyes upon his daughter.  "
Match 2718: " she said.  "
Match 2719: " he broke off angrily, perceiving a slight movement on her part to one side. "
Match 2720: "  "
Match 2721: " she said obstinately.  "
Match 2722: " he replied.  "
Match 2723: " she returned, and as she said it the front door banged to. "
Match 2724: " she exclaimed. "
Match 2725: " she flashed such a look of fiery indignation at her father that he lost his self-control for a moment.  "
Match 2726: " he cried.  she looked for a moment like a wild animal caged in a civilized dwelling-place. she glanced over the walls covered with books, as if for a second she had forgotten the position of the door. then she made as if to go, but her father laid his hand upon her shoulder. he compelled her to sit down.  "
Match 2727: " he said. his manner had regained all its suavity, and he spoke with a soothing assumption of paternal authority. "
Match 2728: "  he made his own choice, and before his daughter could protest or make her escape, she found herself being turned by the agency of sir walter scott into a civilized human being.  yet mr. hilbery had grave doubts, as he read, whether the process was more than skin-deep. civilization had been very profoundly and unpleasantly overthrown that evening; the extent of the ruin was still undetermined; he had lost his temper, a physical disaster not to be matched for the space of ten years or so; and his own condition urgently required soothing and renovating at the hands of the classics. his house was in a state of revolution; he had a vision of unpleasant encounters on the staircase; his meals would be poisoned for days to come; was literature itself a specific against such disagreeables? a note of hollowness was in his voice as he read.    chapter xxxiii  considering that mr. hilbery lived in a house which was accurately numbered in order with its fellows, and that he filled up forms, paid rent, and had seven more years of tenancy to run, he had an excuse for laying down laws for the conduct of those who lived in his house, and this excuse, though profoundly inadequate, he found useful during the interregnum of civilization with which he now found himself faced. in obedience to those laws, rodney disappeared; cassandra was dispatched to catch the eleven-thirty on monday morning; denham was seen no more; so that only katharine, the lawful occupant of the upper rooms, remained, and mr. hilbery thought himself competent to see that she did nothing further to compromise herself. as he bade her good morning next day he was aware that he knew nothing of what she was thinking, but, as he reflected with some bitterness, even this was an advance upon the ignorance of the previous mornings. he went to his study, wrote, tore up, and wrote again a letter to his wife, asking her to come back on account of domestic difficulties which he specified at first, but in a later draft more discreetly left unspecified. even if she started the very moment that she got it, he reflected, she would not be home till tuesday night, and he counted lugubriously the number of hours that he would have to spend in a position of detestable authority alone with his daughter.  what was she doing now, he wondered, as he addressed the envelope to his wife. he could not control the telephone. he could not play the spy. she might be making any arrangements she chose. yet the thought did not disturb him so much as the strange, unpleasant, illicit atmosphere of the whole scene with the young people the night before. his sense of discomfort was almost physical.  had he known it, katharine was far enough withdrawn, both physically and spiritually, from the telephone. she sat in her room with the dictionaries spreading their wide leaves on the table before her, and all the pages which they had concealed for so many years arranged in a pile. she worked with the steady concentration that is produced by the successful effort to think down some unwelcome thought by means of another thought. having absorbed the unwelcome thought, her mind went on with additional vigor, derived from the victory; on a sheet of paper lines of figures and symbols frequently and firmly written down marked the different stages of its progress. and yet it was broad daylight; there were sounds of knocking and sweeping, which proved that living people were at work on the other side of the door, and the door, which could be thrown open in a second, was her only protection against the world. but she had somehow risen to be mistress in her own kingdom, assuming her sovereignty unconsciously.  steps approached her unheard. it is true that they were steps that lingered, divagated, and mounted with the deliberation natural to one past sixty whose arms, moreover, are full of leaves and blossoms; but they came on steadily, and soon a tap of laurel boughs against the door arrested katharine's pencil as it touched the page. she did not move, however, and sat blank-eyed as if waiting for the interruption to cease. instead, the door opened. at first, she attached no meaning to the moving mass of green which seemed to enter the room independently of any human agency. then she recognized parts of her mother's face and person behind the yellow flowers and soft velvet of the palm-buds.  "
Match 2729: " exclaimed mrs. hilbery, dropping the entire mass upon the floor, with a gesture that seemed to indicate an act of dedication. then she flung her arms wide and embraced her daughter.  "
Match 2730: " she exclaimed. "
Match 2731: " she repeated.  "
Match 2732: " said katharine, very vaguely, standing up to receive the embrace.  although she recognized her mother's presence, she was very far from taking part in the scene, and yet felt it to be amazingly appropriate that her mother should be there, thanking god emphatically for unknown blessings, and strewing the floor with flowers and leaves from shakespeare's tomb.  "
Match 2733: " mrs. hilbery continued. "
Match 2734: "  "
Match 2735: " katharine repeated her mother's words softly and vaguely, looking past her. "
Match 2736: " she began, like a child, to finger a tassel hanging from her mother's cloak.  "
Match 2737: "  katharine seemed to consider each of these proofs separately. then she said gravely:  "
Match 2738: "  "
Match 2739: " said mrs. hilbery. "
Match 2740: " she asked impulsively, "
Match 2741: "  katharine recollected with difficulty.  "
Match 2742: " she remembered.  "
Match 2743: " said mrs. hilbery, with a slight note of disappointment in her voice. "
Match 2744: " she looked at her daughter. katharine faltered beneath that innocent and penetrating gaze; she flushed, turned away, and then looked up with very bright eyes.  "
Match 2745: " she said.  "
Match 2746: " said mrs. hilbery very quickly. "
Match 2747: " she added, glancing momentarily at her daughter, "
Match 2748: "  "
Match 2749: " katharine continued.  "
Match 2750: " mrs. hilbery ran over these phrases as if she were trying chords that did not quite satisfy her ear. it was plain that she had her sources of information, and, indeed, her bag was stuffed with what she called "
Match 2751: " from the pen of her sister-in-law.  "
Match 2752: " katharine concluded.  mrs. hilbery paused, looked unhappy, and sought inspiration from the window.  "
Match 2753: "  "
Match 2754: "  "
Match 2755: " mrs. hilbery inquired.  "
Match 2756: " katharine began to describe her visit, and soon mrs. hilbery elicited the facts that not only was the house of excruciating ugliness, which ralph bore without complaint, but that it was evident that every one depended on him, and he had a room at the top of the house, with a wonderful view over london, and a rook.  "
Match 2757: " she said, with a tenderness in her voice that seemed to commiserate the sufferings of humanity while resting assured in the capacity of ralph denham to alleviate them, so that mrs. hilbery could not help exclaiming:  "
Match 2758: " at which katharine flushed, looked startled, as if she had said something that she ought not to have said, and shook her head.  hastily mrs. hilbery asked for further details of this extraordinary house, and interposed a few speculations about the meeting between keats and coleridge in a lane, which tided over the discomfort of the moment, and drew katharine on to further descriptions and indiscretions. in truth, she found an extraordinary pleasure in being thus free to talk to some one who was equally wise and equally benignant, the mother of her earliest childhood, whose silence seemed to answer questions that were never asked. mrs. hilbery listened without making any remark for a considerable time. she seemed to draw her conclusions rather by looking at her daughter than by listening to her, and, if cross-examined, she would probably have given a highly inaccurate version of ralph denham's life-history except that he was penniless, fatherless, and lived at highgate--all of which was much in his favor. but by means of these furtive glances she had assured herself that katharine was in a state which gave her, alternately, the most exquisite pleasure and the most profound alarm.  she could not help ejaculating at last:  "
Match 2759: "  "
Match 2760: " katharine replied emphatically, and added, "
Match 2761: "  again mrs. hilbery looked discomposed, and, in her trouble, took up the sheets which were lying upon the table, and began turning them over this way and that, and muttering to herself as she glanced:  "
Match 2762: "  katharine took the sheets from her mother's hand and began shuffling them absent-mindedly together, for her fixed gaze seemed to show that her thoughts were intent upon some other matter.  "
Match 2763: " she said at length.  "
Match 2764: " mrs. hilbery exclaimed. "
Match 2765: "  "
Match 2766: "  "
Match 2767: "  "
Match 2768: "  mrs. hilbery, her eyes growing blank, peered down the enormously long corridor of days at the far end of which the little figures of herself and her husband appeared fantastically attired, clasping hands upon a moonlit beach, with roses swinging in the dusk.  "
Match 2769: " she began. "
Match 2770: "  the ancient fairy-tale fell roundly and harmoniously upon katharine's ears. yes, there was the enormous space of the sea; there were the three green lights upon the steamer; the cloaked figures climbed up on deck. and so, voyaging over the green and purple waters, past the cliffs and the sandy lagoons and through pools crowded with the masts of ships and the steeples of churches--here they were. the river seemed to have brought them and deposited them here at this precise point. she looked admiringly at her mother, that ancient voyager.  "
Match 2771: " exclaimed mrs. hilbery, continuing her reveries, "
Match 2772: " she crooned, and the soft sound beating through the dim words was heard by her daughter as the breaking of waves solemnly in order upon the vast shore that she gazed upon. she would have been content for her mother to repeat that word almost indefinitely--a soothing word when uttered by another, a riveting together of the shattered fragments of the world. but mrs. hilbery, instead of repeating the word love, said pleadingly:  "
Match 2773: " at which words the ship which katharine had been considering seemed to put into harbor and have done with its seafaring. yet she was in great need, if not exactly of sympathy, of some form of advice, or, at least, of the opportunity of setting forth her problems before a third person so as to renew them in her own eyes.  "
Match 2774: " she said, ignoring the difficult problem of ugliness, "
Match 2775: " she continued, frowning a little as she tried to fix the difficult feeling, "
Match 2776: " she continued, "
Match 2777: " mrs. hilbery waited patiently for the sentence to be completed, but katharine fell silent and fingered her sheet of figures.  "
Match 2778: " mrs. hilbery resumed, glancing at the figures, which distressed her vaguely, and had some connection in her mind with the household accounts, "
Match 2779: " she cast a lightning glance into the depths of disillusionment which were, perhaps, not altogether unknown to her.  "
Match 2780: " she said earnestly, and sighed. they looked together into the abyss and, as the elder of the two, she recovered herself first and asked:  "
Match 2781: "  katharine's expression changed instantly.  "
Match 2782: " she replied bitterly.  mrs. hilbery brushed this aside.  "
Match 2783: " she asked.  katharine looked at her as if, indeed, she were some magician. once more she felt that instead of being a grown woman, used to advise and command, she was only a foot or two raised above the long grass and the little flowers and entirely dependent upon the figure of indefinite size whose head went up into the sky, whose hand was in hers, for guidance.  "
Match 2784: " she said simply.  mrs. hilbery nodded her head in a manner which indicated complete understanding, and the immediate conception of certain plans for the future. she swept up her flowers, breathed in their sweetness, and, humming a little song about a miller's daughter, left the room.  the case upon which ralph denham was engaged that afternoon was not apparently receiving his full attention, and yet the affairs of the late john leake of dublin were sufficiently confused to need all the care that a solicitor could bestow upon them, if the widow leake and the five leake children of tender age were to receive any pittance at all. but the appeal to ralph's humanity had little chance of being heard to-day; he was no longer a model of concentration. the partition so carefully erected between the different sections of his life had been broken down, with the result that though his eyes were fixed upon the last will and testament, he saw through the page a certain drawing-room in cheyne walk.  he tried every device that had proved effective in the past for keeping up the partitions of the mind, until he could decently go home; but a little to his alarm he found himself assailed so persistently, as if from outside, by katharine, that he launched forth desperately into an imaginary interview with her. she obliterated a bookcase full of law reports, and the corners and lines of the room underwent a curious softening of outline like that which sometimes makes a room unfamiliar at the moment of waking from sleep. by degrees, a pulse or stress began to beat at regular intervals in his mind, heaping his thoughts into waves to which words fitted themselves, and without much consciousness of what he was doing, he began to write on a sheet of draft paper what had the appearance of a poem lacking several words in each line. not many lines had been set down, however, before he threw away his pen as violently as if that were responsible for his misdeeds, and tore the paper into many separate pieces. this was a sign that katharine had asserted herself and put to him a remark that could not be met poetically. her remark was entirely destructive of poetry, since it was to the effect that poetry had nothing whatever to do with her; all her friends spent their lives in making up phrases, she said; all his feeling was an illusion, and next moment, as if to taunt him with his impotence, she had sunk into one of those dreamy states which took no account whatever of his existence. ralph was roused by his passionate attempts to attract her attention to the fact that he was standing in the middle of his little private room in lincoln's inn fields at a considerable distance from chelsea. the physical distance increased his desperation. he began pacing in circles until the process sickened him, and then took a sheet of paper for the composition of a letter which, he vowed before he began it, should be sent that same evening.  it was a difficult matter to put into words; poetry would have done it better justice, but he must abstain from poetry. in an infinite number of half-obliterated scratches he tried to convey to her the possibility that although human beings are woefully ill-adapted for communication, still, such communion is the best we know; moreover, they make it possible for each to have access to another world independent of personal affairs, a world of law, of philosophy, or more strangely a world such as he had had a glimpse of the other evening when together they seemed to be sharing something, creating something, an ideal--a vision flung out in advance of our actual circumstances. if this golden rim were quenched, if life were no longer circled by an illusion (but was it an illusion after all?), then it would be too dismal an affair to carry to an end; so he wrote with a sudden spurt of conviction which made clear way for a space and left at least one sentence standing whole. making every allowance for other desires, on the whole this conclusion appeared to him to justify their relationship. but the conclusion was mystical; it plunged him into thought. the difficulty with which even this amount was written, the inadequacy of the words, and the need of writing under them and over them others which, after all, did no better, led him to leave off before he was at all satisfied with his production, and unable to resist the conviction that such rambling would never be fit for katharine's eye. he felt himself more cut off from her than ever. in idleness, and because he could do nothing further with words, he began to draw little figures in the blank spaces, heads meant to resemble her head, blots fringed with flames meant to represent--perhaps the entire universe. from this occupation he was roused by the message that a lady wished to speak to him. he had scarcely time to run his hands through his hair in order to look as much like a solicitor as possible, and to cram his papers into his pocket, already overcome with shame that another eye should behold them, when he realized that his preparations were needless. the lady was mrs. hilbery.  "
Match 2785: " she remarked, gazing at the documents on his table, "
Match 2786: "  the effect of these parentheses, whether they were introduced for that purpose or represented a natural instinct on mrs. hilbery's part to embellish the bareness of her discourse, gave ralph time to perceive that she possessed all the facts of their situation and was come, somehow, in the capacity of ambassador.  "
Match 2787: " mrs. hilbery continued, with a little laugh, "
Match 2788: " she paused. "
Match 2789: " she exclaimed, "
Match 2790: "  ralph, whose hand was grasped and whose tongue almost refused to articulate, somehow contrived to say that there were moments when he felt hopeless, utterly hopeless, though he gave no reason for this statement on his part.  "
Match 2791: " mrs. hilbery inquired.  "
Match 2792: " he exclaimed, with a vehemence which admitted of no question.  "
Match 2793: " mrs. hilbery inquired innocently.  "
Match 2794: " ralph replied.  "
Match 2795: " mrs. hilbery inquired.  "
Match 2796: " ralph replied. his doubts upon this point, which were always roused by katharine's presence, had vanished completely, and his strongest wish in the world was to be with her immediately, since every second he was away from her he imagined her slipping farther and farther from him into one of those states of mind in which he was unrepresented. he wished to dominate her, to possess her.  "
Match 2797: " exclaimed mrs. hilbery. she thanked him for a variety of blessings: for the conviction with which the young man spoke; and not least for the prospect that on her daughter's wedding-day the noble cadences, the stately periods, the ancient eloquence of the marriage service would resound over the heads of a distinguished congregation gathered together near the very spot where her father lay quiescent with the other poets of england. the tears filled her eyes; but she remembered simultaneously that her carriage was waiting, and with dim eyes she walked to the door. denham followed her downstairs.  it was a strange drive. for denham it was without exception the most unpleasant he had ever taken. his only wish was to go as straightly and quickly as possible to cheyne walk; but it soon appeared that mrs. hilbery either ignored or thought fit to baffle this desire by interposing various errands of her own. she stopped the carriage at post-offices, and coffee-shops, and shops of inscrutable dignity where the aged attendants had to be greeted as old friends; and, catching sight of the dome of st. paul's above the irregular spires of ludgate hill, she pulled the cord impulsively, and gave directions that anderson should drive them there. but anderson had reasons of his own for discouraging afternoon worship, and kept his horse's nose obstinately towards the west. after some minutes, mrs. hilbery realized the situation, and accepted it good-humoredly, apologizing to ralph for his disappointment.  "
Match 2798: " she said, "
Match 2799: "  ralph was scarcely aware of what she went on to say. her mind and body both seemed to have floated into another region of quick-sailing clouds rapidly passing across each other and enveloping everything in a vaporous indistinctness. meanwhile he remained conscious of his own concentrated desire, his impotence to bring about anything he wished, and his increasing agony of impatience.  suddenly mrs. hilbery pulled the cord with such decision that even anderson had to listen to the order which she leant out of the window to give him. the carriage pulled up abruptly in the middle of whitehall before a large building dedicated to one of our government offices. in a second mrs. hilbery was mounting the steps, and ralph was left in too acute an irritation by this further delay even to speculate what errand took her now to the board of education. he was about to jump from the carriage and take a cab, when mrs. hilbery reappeared talking genially to a figure who remained hidden behind her.  "
Match 2800: " she was saying. "
Match 2801: " she added, opening the door, and ralph found that rodney had now joined their company. the two men glanced at each other. if distress, shame, discomfort in its most acute form were ever visible upon a human face, ralph could read them all expressed beyond the eloquence of words upon the face of his unfortunate companion. but mrs. hilbery was either completely unseeing or determined to appear so. she went on talking; she talked, it seemed to both the young men, to some one outside, up in the air. she talked about shakespeare, she apostrophized the human race, she proclaimed the virtues of divine poetry, she began to recite verses which broke down in the middle. the great advantage of her discourse was that it was self-supporting. it nourished itself until cheyne walk was reached upon half a dozen grunts and murmurs.  "
Match 2802: " she said, alighting briskly at her door, "
Match 2803: "  there was something airy and ironical in her voice and expression as she turned upon the doorstep and looked at them, which filled both rodney and denham with the same misgivings at having trusted their fortunes to such an ambassador; and rodney actually hesitated upon the threshold and murmured to denham:  "
Match 2804: " he was turning tail, but the door opening and the familiar look of the house asserting its charm, he bolted in on the wake of the others, and the door shut upon his escape. mrs. hilbery led the way upstairs. she took them to the drawing-room. the fire burnt as usual, the little tables were laid with china and silver. there was nobody there.  "
Match 2805: " she said, "
Match 2806: " she vaguely indicated the ceiling with a gesture of her hand. she had become suddenly serious and composed, mistress in her own house. the gesture with which she dismissed him had a dignity that ralph never forgot. she seemed to make him free with a wave of her hand to all that she possessed. he left the room.  the hilberys' house was tall, possessing many stories and passages with closed doors, all, once he had passed the drawing-room floor, unknown to ralph. he mounted as high as he could and knocked at the first door he came to.  "
Match 2807: " he asked.  a voice from within answered "
Match 2808: "  he was conscious of a large window, full of light, of a bare table, and of a long looking-glass. katharine had risen, and was standing with some white papers in her hand, which slowly fluttered to the ground as she saw her visitor. the explanation was a short one. the sounds were inarticulate; no one could have understood the meaning save themselves. as if the forces of the world were all at work to tear them asunder they sat, clasping hands, near enough to be taken even by the malicious eye of time himself for a united couple, an indivisible unit.  "
Match 2809: " she begged of him, when he stooped to gather the papers she had let fall. but he took them in his hands and, giving her by a sudden impulse his own unfinished dissertation, with its mystical conclusion, they read each other's compositions in silence.  katharine read his sheets to an end; ralph followed her figures as far as his mathematics would let him. they came to the end of their tasks at about the same moment, and sat for a time in silence.  "
Match 2810: " said ralph at length. "
Match 2811: "  she blushed very deeply; but as she did not move or attempt to hide her face she had the appearance of some one disarmed of all defences, or ralph likened her to a wild bird just settling with wings trembling to fold themselves within reach of his hand. the moment of exposure had been exquisitely painful--the light shed startlingly vivid. she had now to get used to the fact that some one shared her loneliness. the bewilderment was half shame and half the prelude to profound rejoicing. nor was she unconscious that on the surface the whole thing must appear of the utmost absurdity. she looked to see whether ralph smiled, but found his gaze fixed on her with such gravity that she turned to the belief that she had committed no sacrilege but enriched herself, perhaps immeasurably, perhaps eternally. she hardly dared steep herself in the infinite bliss. but his glance seemed to ask for some assurance upon another point of vital interest to him. it beseeched her mutely to tell him whether what she had read upon his confused sheet had any meaning or truth to her. she bent her head once more to the papers she held.  "
Match 2812: " she said meditatively.  ralph nearly tore the page from her hand in shame and despair when he saw her actually contemplating the idiotic symbol of his most confused and emotional moments.  he was convinced that it could mean nothing to another, although somehow to him it conveyed not only katharine herself but all those states of mind which had clustered round her since he first saw her pouring out tea on a sunday afternoon. it represented by its circumference of smudges surrounding a central blot all that encircling glow which for him surrounded, inexplicably, so many of the objects of life, softening their sharp outline, so that he could see certain streets, books, and situations wearing a halo almost perceptible to the physical eye. did she smile? did she put the paper down wearily, condemning it not only for its inadequacy but for its falsity? was she going to protest once more that he only loved the vision of her? but it did not occur to her that this diagram had anything to do with her. she said simply, and in the same tone of reflection:  "
Match 2813: "  he received her assurance with profound joy. quietly and steadily there rose up behind the whole aspect of life that soft edge of fire which gave its red tint to the atmosphere and crowded the scene with shadows so deep and dark that one could fancy pushing farther into their density and still farther, exploring indefinitely. whether there was any correspondence between the two prospects now opening before them they shared the same sense of the impending future, vast, mysterious, infinitely stored with undeveloped shapes which each would unwrap for the other to behold; but for the present the prospect of the future was enough to fill them with silent adoration. at any rate, their further attempts to communicate articulately were interrupted by a knock on the door, and the entrance of a maid who, with a due sense of mystery, announced that a lady wished to see miss hilbery, but refused to allow her name to be given.  when katharine rose, with a profound sigh, to resume her duties, ralph went with her, and neither of them formulated any guess, on their way downstairs, as to who this anonymous lady might prove to be. perhaps the fantastic notion that she was a little black hunchback provided with a steel knife, which she would plunge into katharine's heart, appeared to ralph more probable than another, and he pushed first into the dining-room to avert the blow. then he exclaimed "
Match 2814: " with such heartiness at the sight of cassandra otway standing by the dining-room table that she put her finger to her lips and begged him to be quiet.  "
Match 2815: " she explained in a sepulchral whisper. "
Match 2816: "  katharine pushed forward a chair; ralph hastily found wine and poured it out for her. if not actually fainting, she was very near it.  "
Match 2817: " said ralph, as soon as she appeared to be recovered. "
Match 2818: " his own happiness had given him a confidence that every one else was bound to be happy too. but cassandra had her uncle's commands and anger too vividly in her mind to dare any such defiance. she became agitated and said that she must leave the house at once. she was not in a condition to go, had they known where to send her. katharine's common sense, which had been in abeyance for the past week or two, still failed her, and she could only ask, "
Match 2819: " in the vague belief that to take lodgings depended entirely upon a sufficiency of luggage. cassandra's reply, "
Match 2820: " in no way helped her to a conclusion.  "
Match 2821: " she repeated. her eyes rested upon ralph, with an expression which seemed better fitted to accompany a profound thanksgiving for his existence or some vow of eternal devotion than a question about luggage. cassandra perceived the look, and saw that it was returned; her eyes filled with tears. she faltered in what she was saying. she began bravely again to discuss the question of lodging when katharine, who seemed to have communicated silently with ralph, and obtained his permission, took her ruby ring from her finger and giving it to cassandra, said: "
Match 2822: "  these words would not have been enough to convince cassandra of what she very much wished to believe had not ralph taken the bare hand in his and demanded:  "
Match 2823: " cassandra was so glad that the tears ran down her cheeks. the certainty of katharine's engagement not only relieved her of a thousand vague fears and self-reproaches, but entirely quenched that spirit of criticism which had lately impaired her belief in katharine. her old faith came back to her. she seemed to behold her with that curious intensity which she had lost; as a being who walks just beyond our sphere, so that life in their presence is a heightened process, illuminating not only ourselves but a considerable stretch of the surrounding world. next moment she contrasted her own lot with theirs and gave back the ring.  "
Match 2824: " she said. "
Match 2825: "  "
Match 2826: " said ralph. "
Match 2827: "  he was about, in spite of cassandra's protest, to reach the door, when mrs. hilbery, either warned by the parlor-maid or conscious with her usual prescience of the need for her intervention, opened the door and smilingly surveyed them.  "
Match 2828: " she exclaimed. "
Match 2829: " she observed, in a general way. "
Match 2830: " she seemed to have proved something to her own satisfaction, although nobody felt certain what thing precisely it was.  "
Match 2831: " she repeated.  "
Match 2832: " katharine interposed, seeing that cassandra was unable to speak.  "
Match 2833: " began mrs. hilbery, drawing inspiration from the portraits on the wall apparently, "
Match 2834: " but she pulled herself up and remarked that the kettle must have boiled completely over everything.  to katharine's agitated mind it appeared that this kettle was an enormous kettle, capable of deluging the house in its incessant showers of steam, the enraged representative of all those household duties which she had neglected. she ran hastily up to the drawing-room, and the rest followed her, for mrs. hilbery put her arm round cassandra and drew her upstairs. they found rodney observing the kettle with uneasiness but with such absence of mind that katharine's catastrophe was in a fair way to be fulfilled. in putting the matter straight no greetings were exchanged, but rodney and cassandra chose seats as far apart as possible, and sat down with an air of people making a very temporary lodgment. either mrs. hilbery was impervious to their discomfort, or chose to ignore it, or thought it high time that the subject was changed, for she did nothing but talk about shakespeare's tomb.  "
Match 2835: " she mused, and went on to sing her strange, half-earthly song of dawns and sunsets, of great poets, and the unchanged spirit of noble loving which they had taught, so that nothing changes, and one age is linked with another, and no one dies, and we all meet in spirit, until she appeared oblivious of any one in the room. but suddenly her remarks seemed to contract the enormously wide circle in which they were soaring and to alight, airily and temporarily, upon matters of more immediate moment.  "
Match 2836: " she said, as if to try the sound. "
Match 2837: "  "
Match 2838: " said william desperately, thrusting himself into this breach in her reflections. "
Match 2839: "  "
Match 2840: " cassandra interrupted. "
Match 2841: "  "
Match 2842: " rodney went on, rising from his seat, in which movement he was imitated simultaneously by cassandra. "
Match 2843: "--he looked at katharine, stammered, and fell silent--"
Match 2844: " he forced himself to continue. "
Match 2845: " he repeated, like a speaker who has lost his notes.  two emotions seemed to be struggling in katharine; one the desire to laugh at the ridiculous spectacle of william making her a formal speech across the tea-table, the other a desire to weep at the sight of something childlike and honest in him which touched her inexpressibly. to every one's surprise she rose, stretched out her hand, and said:  "
Match 2846: " but here her voice died away, and the tears forced themselves into her eyes, and ran down her cheeks, while william, equally moved, seized her hand and pressed it to his lips. no one perceived that the drawing-room door had opened itself sufficiently to admit at least half the person of mr. hilbery, or saw him gaze at the scene round the tea-table with an expression of the utmost disgust and expostulation. he withdrew unseen. he paused outside on the landing trying to recover his self-control and to decide what course he might with most dignity pursue. it was obvious to him that his wife had entirely confused the meaning of his instructions. she had plunged them all into the most odious confusion. he waited a moment, and then, with much preliminary rattling of the handle, opened the door a second time. they had all regained their places; some incident of an absurd nature had now set them laughing and looking under the table, so that his entrance passed momentarily unperceived. katharine, with flushed cheeks, raised her head and said:  "
Match 2847: "  "
Match 2848: " said ralph, stooping to turn up the corner of the hearthrug.  "
Match 2849: " mrs. hilbery began, and then saw her husband and exclaimed: "
Match 2850: "  mr. hilbery looked instinctively at the carpet. remarkably enough, the ring had rolled to the very point where he stood. he saw the rubies touching the tip of his boot. such is the force of habit that he could not refrain from stooping, with an absurd little thrill of pleasure at being the one to find what others were looking for, and, picking the ring up, he presented it, with a bow that was courtly in the extreme, to cassandra. whether the making of a bow released automatically feelings of complaisance and urbanity, mr. hilbery found his resentment completely washed away during the second in which he bent and straightened himself. cassandra dared to offer her cheek and received his embrace. he nodded with some degree of stiffness to rodney and denham, who had both risen upon seeing him, and now altogether sat down. mrs. hilbery seemed to have been waiting for the entrance of her husband, and for this precise moment in order to put to him a question which, from the ardor with which she announced it, had evidently been pressing for utterance for some time past.  "
Match 2851: "  in order to answer her mr. hilbery had to have recourse to the exact scholarship of william rodney, and before he had given his excellent authorities for believing as he believed, rodney felt himself admitted once more to the society of the civilized and sanctioned by the authority of no less a person than shakespeare himself. the power of literature, which had temporarily deserted mr. hilbery, now came back to him, pouring over the raw ugliness of human affairs its soothing balm, and providing a form into which such passions as he had felt so painfully the night before could be molded so that they fell roundly from the tongue in shapely phrases, hurting nobody. he was sufficiently sure of his command of language at length to look at katharine and again at denham. all this talk about shakespeare had acted as a soporific, or rather as an incantation upon katharine. she leaned back in her chair at the head of the tea-table, perfectly silent, looking vaguely past them all, receiving the most generalized ideas of human heads against pictures, against yellow-tinted walls, against curtains of deep crimson velvet. denham, to whom he turned next, shared her immobility under his gaze. but beneath his restraint and calm it was possible to detect a resolution, a will, set now with unalterable tenacity, which made such turns of speech as mr. hilbery had at command appear oddly irrelevant. at any rate, he said nothing. he respected the young man; he was a very able young man; he was likely to get his own way. he could, he thought, looking at his still and very dignified head, understand katharine's preference, and, as he thought this, he was surprised by a pang of acute jealousy. she might have married rodney without causing him a twinge. this man she loved. or what was the state of affairs between them? an extraordinary confusion of emotion was beginning to get the better of him, when mrs. hilbery, who had been conscious of a sudden pause in the conversation, and had looked wistfully at her daughter once or twice, remarked:  "
Match 2852: "  "
Match 2853: " said katharine, waking with a start, and looking straight at her father. he was taken aback by the directness of the statement; he exclaimed as if an unexpected blow had struck him. had he loved her to see her swept away by this torrent, to have her taken from him by this uncontrollable force, to stand by helpless, ignored? oh, how he loved her! how he loved her! he nodded very curtly to denham.  "
Match 2854: " he said. "
Match 2855: " but he never looked at his daughter, and strode out of the room, leaving in the minds of the women a sense, half of awe, half of amusement, at the extravagant, inconsiderate, uncivilized male, outraged somehow and gone bellowing to his lair with a roar which still sometimes reverberates in the most polished of drawing-rooms. then katharine, looking at the shut door, looked down again, to hide her tears.    chapter xxxiv  the lamps were lit; their luster reflected itself in the polished wood; good wine was passed round the dinner-table; before the meal was far advanced civilization had triumphed, and mr. hilbery presided over a feast which came to wear more and more surely an aspect, cheerful, dignified, promising well for the future. to judge from the expression in katharine's eyes it promised something--but he checked the approach sentimentality. he poured out wine; he bade denham help himself.  they went upstairs and he saw katharine and denham abstract themselves directly cassandra had asked whether she might not play him something--some mozart? some beethoven? she sat down to the piano; the door closed softly behind them. his eyes rested on the closed door for some seconds unwaveringly, but, by degrees, the look of expectation died out of them, and, with a sigh, he listened to the music.  katharine and ralph were agreed with scarcely a word of discussion as to what they wished to do, and in a moment she joined him in the hall dressed for walking. the night was still and moonlit, fit for walking, though any night would have seemed so to them, desiring more than anything movement, freedom from scrutiny, silence, and the open air.  "
Match 2856: " she breathed, as the front door shut. she told him how she had waited, fidgeted, thought he was never coming, listened for the sound of doors, half expected to see him again under the lamp-post, looking at the house. they turned and looked at the serene front with its gold-rimmed windows, to him the shrine of so much adoration. in spite of her laugh and the little pressure of mockery on his arm, he would not resign his belief, but with her hand resting there, her voice quickened and mysteriously moving in his ears, he had not time--they had not the same inclination--other objects drew his attention.  how they came to find themselves walking down a street with many lamps, corners radiant with light, and a steady succession of motor-omnibuses plying both ways along it, they could neither of them tell; nor account for the impulse which led them suddenly to select one of these wayfarers and mount to the very front seat. after curving through streets of comparative darkness, so narrow that shadows on the blinds were pressed within a few feet of their faces, they came to one of those great knots of activity where the lights, having drawn close together, thin out again and take their separate ways. they were borne on until they saw the spires of the city churches pale and flat against the sky.  "
Match 2857: " he asked, as they stopped by temple bar.  "
Match 2858: " she replied, becoming conscious that the splendid race of lights drawn past her eyes by the superb curving and swerving of the monster on which she sat was at an end. they had followed some such course in their thoughts too; they had been borne on, victors in the forefront of some triumphal car, spectators of a pageant enacted for them, masters of life. but standing on the pavement alone, this exaltation left them; they were glad to be alone together. ralph stood still for a moment to light his pipe beneath a lamp.  she looked at his face isolated in the little circle of light.  "
Match 2859: " she said. "
Match 2860: "  "
Match 2861: " he inquired.  "
Match 2862: " she replied. she thought, looking at the sky above chancery lane, how the roof was the same everywhere; how she was now secure of all that this lofty blue and its steadfast lights meant to her; reality, was it, figures, love, truth?  "
Match 2863: " said ralph abruptly. "
Match 2864: "  she had turned before she answered him. she had no wish to see any one to-night; it seemed to her that the immense riddle was answered; the problem had been solved; she held in her hands for one brief moment the globe which we spend our lives in trying to shape, round, whole, and entire from the confusion of chaos. to see mary was to risk the destruction of this globe.  "
Match 2865: " she asked rather mechanically, walking on.  "
Match 2866: " he said, almost defiantly. "
Match 2867: " he said. "
Match 2868: "  "
Match 2869: " said katharine, and now felt anxious for him to do what appeared to be necessary if he, too, were to hold his globe for a moment round, whole, and entire.  "
Match 2870: " she sighed, for melancholy came over her and obscured at least a section of her clear vision. the globe swam before her as if obscured by tears.  "
Match 2871: " said ralph firmly. she leant towards him almost as if she could thus see what he saw. she thought how obscure he still was to her, save only that more and more constantly he appeared to her a fire burning through its smoke, a source of life.  "
Match 2872: " she said. "
Match 2873: "  "
Match 2874: " he repeated.  "
Match 2875: " she thought to herself. she thought of him blazing splendidly in the night, yet so obscure that to hold his arm, as she held it, was only to touch the opaque substance surrounding the flame that roared upwards.  "
Match 2876: " she asked hurriedly, in order that he might say more and so make more splendid, more red, more darkly intertwined with smoke this flame rushing upwards.  "
Match 2877: " he asked suspiciously, noticing her tone of dreaminess and the inapt words.  "
Match 2878: "  beginning with spasmodic words, he went on to speak more and more fluently, more and more passionately, feeling her leaning towards him, listening with wonder like a child, with gratitude like a woman. she interrupted him gravely now and then.  "
Match 2879: "  he capped her reproof with wonderment that a woman of her age could have stood in kingsway looking at the traffic until she forgot.  "
Match 2880: " she exclaimed.  "
Match 2881: " he begged her.  "
Match 2882: " she pleaded. "
Match 2883: "  but he persuaded her into a broken statement, beautiful to him, charged with extreme excitement as she spoke of the dark red fire, and the smoke twined round it, making him feel that he had stepped over the threshold into the faintly lit vastness of another mind, stirring with shapes, so large, so dim, unveiling themselves only in flashes, and moving away again into the darkness, engulfed by it. they had walked by this time to the street in which mary lived, and being engrossed by what they said and partly saw, passed her staircase without looking up. at this time of night there was no traffic and scarcely any foot-passengers, so that they could pace slowly without interruption, arm-in-arm, raising their hands now and then to draw something upon the vast blue curtain of the sky.  they brought themselves by these means, acting on a mood of profound happiness, to a state of clear-sightedness where the lifting of a finger had effect, and one word spoke more than a sentence. they lapsed gently into silence, traveling the dark paths of thought side by side towards something discerned in the distance which gradually possessed them both. they were victors, masters of life, but at the same time absorbed in the flame, giving their life to increase its brightness, to testify to their faith. thus they had walked, perhaps, twice or three times up and down mary datchet's street before the recurrence of a light burning behind a thin, yellow blind caused them to stop without exactly knowing why they did so. it burned itself into their minds.  "
Match 2884: " said ralph. "
Match 2885: " he pointed across the street. katharine's eyes rested there too.  "
Match 2886: " she wondered. "
Match 2887: " she asked passionately. "
Match 2888: " she added. "
Match 2889: " her voice shook slightly, and the light swam like an ocean of gold behind her tears.  "
Match 2890: " ralph asked.  "
Match 2891: " she replied.  he crossed the road immediately, and went up the steps into mary's house. katharine stood where he left her, looking at the window and expecting soon to see a shadow move across it; but she saw nothing; the blinds conveyed nothing; the light was not moved. it signaled to her across the dark street; it was a sign of triumph shining there for ever, not to be extinguished this side of the grave. she brandished her happiness as if in salute; she dipped it as if in reverence. "
Match 2892: " she thought, and all the darkness of london seemed set with fires, roaring upwards; but her eyes came back to mary's window and rested there satisfied. she had waited some time before a figure detached itself from the doorway and came across the road, slowly and reluctantly, to where she stood.  "
Match 2893: " he broke off. he had stood outside mary's door unable to bring himself to knock; if she had come out she would have found him there, the tears running down his cheeks, unable to speak.  they stood for some moments, looking at the illuminated blinds, an expression to them both of something impersonal and serene in the spirit of the woman within, working out her plans far into the night--her plans for the good of a world that none of them were ever to know. then their minds jumped on and other little figures came by in procession, headed, in ralph's view, by the figure of sally seal.  "
Match 2894: " he asked. katharine bent her head.  "
Match 2895: " he went on. "
Match 2896: " he stopped in his enumeration, not finding it possible to link them together in any way that should explain the queer combination which he could perceive in them, as he thought of them. they appeared to him to be more than individuals; to be made up of many different things in cohesion; he had a vision of an orderly world.  "
Match 2897: " katherine quoted, remembering some words of sally seal's, and wishing ralph to understand that she followed the track of his thought. she felt him trying to piece together in a laborious and elementary fashion fragments of belief, unsoldered and separate, lacking the unity of phrases fashioned by the old believers. together they groped in this difficult region, where the unfinished, the unfulfilled, the unwritten, the unreturned, came together in their ghostly way and wore the semblance of the complete and the satisfactory. the future emerged more splendid than ever from this construction of the present. books were to be written, and since books must be written in rooms, and rooms must have hangings, and outside the windows there must be land, and an horizon to that land, and trees perhaps, and a hill, they sketched a habitation for themselves upon the outline of great offices in the strand and continued to make an account of the future upon the omnibus which took them towards chelsea; and still, for both of them, it swam miraculously in the golden light of a large steady lamp.  as the night was far advanced they had the whole of the seats on the top of the omnibus to choose from, and the roads, save for an occasional couple, wearing even at midnight, an air of sheltering their words from the public, were deserted. no longer did the shadow of a man sing to the shadow of a piano. a few lights in bedroom windows burnt but were extinguished one by one as the omnibus passed them.  they dismounted and walked down to the river. she felt his arm stiffen beneath her hand, and knew by this token that they had entered the enchanted region. she might speak to him, but with that strange tremor in his voice, those eyes blindly adoring, whom did he answer? what woman did he see? and where was she walking, and who was her companion? moments, fragments, a second of vision, and then the flying waters, the winds dissipating and dissolving; then, too, the recollection from chaos, the return of security, the earth firm, superb and brilliant in the sun. from the heart of his darkness he spoke his thanksgiving; from a region as far, as hidden, she answered him. on a june night the nightingales sing, they answer each other across the plain; they are heard under the window among the trees in the garden. pausing, they looked down into the river which bore its dark tide of waters, endlessly moving, beneath them. they turned and found themselves opposite the house. quietly they surveyed the friendly place, burning its lamps either in expectation of them or because rodney was still there talking to cassandra. katharine pushed the door half open and stood upon the threshold. the light lay in soft golden grains upon the deep obscurity of the hushed and sleeping household. for a moment they waited, and then loosed their hands. "
Match 2898: " he breathed. "
