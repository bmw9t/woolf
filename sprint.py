# sometimes when this is not the case in the text, two quotes will
# appear next to each other. If it blasts the line spaces out of
# existence, it would think that

# It was astonishing that a man of his
# intellect could stoop so low as he did--but that was too harsh a
# phrase--could depend so much as he did upon people's praise.

# "Oh, but," said Lily, "think of his work!"

# the "people's phrase" occurs in the context of a quote, but really
# that's just an artifact of the way i'm formatting the training
# data. So that might throw things off. But then, sometimes she DOES
# punctuate speech with a return before. But in this case I think the
# artifacts produced by it far exceed the positive examples in the
# corpus.
