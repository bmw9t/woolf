# question: the way I have things spaced with returns means that, sometimes when this is not the case in the text, two quotes will appear next to each other. If it blasts the line spaces out of existence, it would think that

# It was astonishing that a man of his
# intellect could stoop so low as he did--but that was too harsh a
# phrase--could depend so much as he did upon people's praise.

# "Oh, but," said Lily, "think of his work!"

# the "people's phrase" occurs in the context of a quote, but really that's just an artifact of the way i'm formatting the training data. So that might throw things off. But then, sometimes she DOES punctuate speech with a return before. But in this case I think the artifacts produced by it far exceed the positive examples in the corpus.
